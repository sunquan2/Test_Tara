As a result, drivers are missing out on features that, although costly, could possibly save their lives.Few new-car buyers bother to try out so-called advanced driver assist systems, which include automatic braking, lane-keeping aids and adaptive cruise control — technology proven to keep drivers safer. A recent McKinsey & Company study estimates 70 per cent of car shoppers are aware of such features, but only a third try them out on a test drive.Shoppers lack detailed knowledge of advanced safety packages partly because many dealers don’t stock cars with the software-driven options, which can add as much as $US6000 ($7921) to the base price.Many salespeople would rather focus on selling more cars than spend time explaining safety technology to customers, researchers say. That is partly because they aren’t well-versed in how the technologies work.Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab researchers recently polled dealer salespeople and found six of the 17 interviewed could properly explain the technology.“Ultimately, it seemed to come down to lack of training, high turnover and the expectation of more work post-sale,” said Hillary Abraham, one of the study’s authors. She said that even if a customer opted for a car with the technology, the salesperson was less likely to explain the safety features as there is no financial gain.The Boston Consulting Group estimates that about 30 per cent of traffic fatalities could be reduced if all new cars had a standard advanced safety package. US vehicle deaths remained near decade-highs in 2017, topping 40,000 for the second year in a row, according to the National Safety Council.The average customer spends at least two hours at a dealership when buying a car, but most of that time is devoted to setting up financing, according to a J.D. Power survey. Customers spend less than 30 minutes taking delivery of the vehicle, during which time a salesperson explains the features.Recognising that salespeople don’t have time to explain all the new technology that cars offer today, from Bluetooth to advanced safety packages, dealers like Quirk Ford outside Boston are using teenagers to inform the customer after the sale has been made. General Manager Mike Quirk said he thought of using the group of 10 teenagers after realising that salespeople would rush through the process.“Technology is constantly changing, and it’s a time-consuming process (to explain),” Mr Quirk said. “We found that in the sales process you don’t have time to do that.” For car manufacturers weathering an industry downturn, the relative lack of adoption of safety packages means they are losing out on an opportunity to increase per-car margins. Car companies could force greater adoption of safety features if they make them more affordable or include them in the price of new cars, analysts say.However, mass-market automakers such as Honda, Subaru and Toyota are making their safety packages standard on models such as the 2019 Subaru Ascent, 2018 Honda Accord and the 2018 Toyota Camry.Luxury-car brands typically include advanced safety gear in their offerings. Among mass-market brands, Nissan is one of the first to make its driver-safety package a standard feature.Dan Mohnke, Nissan’s head of sales in North America, said he realised the benefits of the company’s advanced safety offering, called ProPilot Assist, weren’t being communicated effectively.“We’re working on an ‘invertising’ program just with our employees and our dealers, just from a standpoint of getting everyone to understand the technologies that we have and the advantage that those technologies bring,” he said.",1,,,,No,Quan Sun,Roberts,2018,newspaper article,"Boston, Detroit",Using interviews and synthesizing previous relevant literature,,,,,,,,,"Roberts found that several reasons contribute to auto dealers struggling to explain ADAS features to customers. These reasons include: many dealers don’t stock ADAS features due to cost (additional $ 6,000 over base price), the salesperson might not be well trained on ADAS features due to high salesperson turnover rate and technology rapid updates, the lack of time during car selling, as well as aversion of more post-sale work. It was also noticed that luxury brands typically include the ADAS features on their model, while mass-market models are inclined to take the ADAS features as an addition to their base model.",,,,,,,,"this is not a peer-reviewed article, the robustness of the findings are remained to be tested.",,,,N

The results of our study show several issues about the way that both consumers and car sellers are informed about ADAS.

Almost 40% of the car sellers did not receive (sufficient) information about ADAS. However, brand dealers more often received sufficient information about ADAS compared to independent dealers.

Studies indicate that media and marketing descriptions of vehicle automation affect user perceptions of asystem's capabilities, and later their interaction with the system. Much like “greenwashing”, the capabilities of automation are often overstated. The lack of public awareness of this issue is one of the most critical problems impacting trust calibration and the safe use of vehicle automation.

To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in ADAS-related content and readability among the manuals of the highest selling vehicles in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are seven themes in the user manuals: differences between driving with and without ADAS, familiarisation requirements, operational limits of the ADAS, potential ADAS errors, behaviour adaptation warnings, confusion warnings, and malfunction warnings.

Active parental oversight can improve teen driving safety, and several manufacturers have released teen-focused safety features over the past decade. Still, parents don't always use these systems and often don't even know their vehicle is equipped. A recent survey found that parents who do know about such systems on their vehicle first learned of them from a salesperson at a dealership. The current study examined how salespeople discuss and sell teen-specific safety systems on vehicles to parents shopping for a new teen driver. METHODS: The study focused on four vehicle brands. Two researchers posed as the parents of a new teen driver who were shopping for a vehicle for their teen. They entered dealerships and conducted semistructured interviews with the salesperson that approached them, using prompts of increasing specificity about their teen driver and their interest in safety, and tracking at what point each salesperson mentioned their brand's teen-specific systems, what features they mentioned, and how accurate those mentions were. RESULTS: Thirty of the 40 participating salespeople were able to mention their brand's teen-specific system at some point during the procedure. Hyundai salespeople most consistently brought up their brand's teen features, and Chevy salespeople mentioned the most features while Ford salespeople mentioned the fewest. Salespeople often mentioned speed-related features, although the most commonly mentioned features varied by brand. No participating salespeople reported receiving training specifically about their brand's teen features. DISCUSSION: Most salespeople approached did mention their brand's teen-focused safety systems, but did not usually do so until they had received more targeted prompts. Information these salespeople did share was often vague and general. Salespeople are a key source of information about a vehicle's specific and relevant safety features, and parents without at least some vague preexisting knowledge about the systems or features that could be available on a vehicle of interest are not likely to leave a dealership with a clear idea of all available features that could aid their efforts to keep their teen drivers safe.",,,,,Yes,Quan Sun,Weast et al.,2022,Journal Article,"Rockville, MD","semistructured, role-play interviews (with researchers pretending to be customers)",40,,,,,,"most salespeople could identify the teen-related safety features on the vehicle.

Neither of the latter two differed in objective ADAS knowledge.

Despite our anatomical, physiological, and perceptual shortfalls, the fatality rate in the United Stateshit a historic low of 1.1 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in 2011 (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2011). Fatal crash involvement by VMT increases by age starting in the mid-60s (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2011), and many individuals begin to curtail or stop driving. However, the cessation of driving due to advanced age comes at great cost. Agerelated losses in the ability to drive equates, at best, to aforfeiture of personal freedom, reliance on the assistance of others to meet basic activities of daily living, and can lead toincreased symptoms of depression (Marottoli et al., 1997). Transitions in driving roles occur throughout one’s lifetime. As medical conditions accrue, they can sporadically or permanently limit driving (Owsley, 2004). Women frequently cease driving earlier than men, and often while stillfit to drive (Alsnih & Hensher, 2003; Siren, HakamiesBlomqvist, & Lindeman, 2004). Widowhood can increase older women’s need to drive (Braitman & Williams, 2011) at a time when this is particularly challenging. On theother hand, even as adults age, they are becoming increasingly economically able to purchase new vehicles (Coughlin, 2009). As a consequence of both the increased numbers and economic independence of older adults, innovations in personal mobility that mitigate the burdens of age will grow in value over the coming decades. A move toward new urbanism, including improved public transit systems and walkable streets and sidewalks, is an admirable vision that would help meet the growing needs of manyolder adults. However, it will require, at considerable cost, rebuilding or retrofitting the existing infrastructure at a rate that is not likely to meet the needs of today’s aging boomers. Fully automated or driverless cars, by contrast, represent a path that promises to enhance the mobility optionsof older adults within the existing infrastructure. However, many consumers do not clearly understand that while the basic building blocks of these systems are available today in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), fully automated or driverless vehicles are still on the distant horizon. For the foreseeable future, automated vehicle technologies, including ADAS, will continue to rely on a “responsible” driver to oversee the technology, capable of resuming control and having the foresight to make many (yet to be defined) strategic operational decisions. But because of their transformative promise and heavy news coverage, the prospect of automated cars has become a source of great hope for many. Some believe that fully automated cars,capable of navigating the roadways while the “operator”reads a paper or takes a nap, will be available within a few years. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Instead, there is work to be done to increase the awareness and education necessary to spur the purchasing of ADAS available today,which will support many older drivers’ mobility and safety needs.",1,,1,,Yes,Quan Sun,Bryan Reimer,2014,Journal Article,,,,,,,"“Given the strong association between older adult frailty and fatality in automotive accidents (Li, Braver, & Chen, 2003),” ([Reimer, 2014, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4433127/items/K5J3LVME)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4433127/items/BN8EDQGV?page=2&annotation=D7JC9AIB)) old findings","Findings 1.

Even if that failure rate is smaller than that of unaided human drivers, it may still be difficult for drivers—most of whom have an inflated impression of their driving abilities (McKenna, Stanier, & Lewis, 1991)—to trust a technology that could appear unpredictable (Lee & See, 2004).

A manufacturer would sell their product to a local dealership who would then sell it to the ultimate consumer.' This was true for so long that many states began enacting statutes codifying that market structure in the 1960s after independent dealers raised concerns about the manufacturers using predatory conduct towards them.2 As a result, a system of mandatory vertical disintegration exists across most of the country. Because of this, one could ask his grandfather how he bought his first new car and would likely find himself able to answer the question exactly the same today if he just bought a new car off the lot. And then came the Internet. With the prospect of being able to sell online, costs theoretically should be lower now as consumers easily shop around for the best price for a new car from various dealers across the country, or even directly from the factory. However, these theoretical increases to supply chain efficiencies resulting from Internet retailing have not decreased costs. In fact, e-retailing of new cars is prohibited under nearly every state's laws for the vast majority of manufacturers, that is unless you want to shop online from your neighborhood dealer's website who already contractually controls the local market.4 State motor vehicle laws are proving to be a mechanism for preventing innovation in the new car retailing market for most areas of the country. However, because of subtle, but crucial differences between the state motor vehicle laws, some manufactures are better able to take advantage of the current system. Start-up manufacturers have the choice of vertically integrating their dealer networks in some states, while existing manufacturers cannot in nearly all of them.5 While there may be cost savings for startup manufacturers using this strategy on a state-by-state basis, it also prevents them from entering some states entirely, thus barring revenue prospects. Regardless of the disparity in choices facing manufacturers over how to retail their products depending in part on when they came into existence, a manufacturer, new or old, could make a legal challenge involving the Commerce Clause.6 That is not the only strategy, however. As Tesla Motors found, a piecemeal legislative lobbying strategy is an alternative option for updating outdated state motor vehicle franchising laws.7 Local state administrative agencies also provide some procedural protections if the manufacturer is approved for licensing.8 Manufacturers, both old and new, implementing the strategies discussed in this Note will be better situated to deal with onerous state statutes regulating interactions with their dealership network after adopting a vertically integrated retailing strategy. To start, it is a good idea to understand the origins of these restrictive state statutes.",,,1,1,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

The test case examined a combination of lateral and longitudinal control in addition to an auto-overtake system. Despite putting the driver in control of the automated systems by enabling them to accept or ignore behavioural suggestions (e.g. overtake), there were still issues associated with increased workload and decreased trust.

Peter Hancock advocated for human-centered constraints on autonomous systems, as they may, one day, pose an existential threat to humanity. Dietrich Manzey discussed ethical considerations for autonomous systems, including how design can encourage ethical user behavior. Joachim Meyer argued that HF/E professionals have an obligation to help designers understand the ethical implications of poor design, particularly in the context of autonomous systems. Lastly, Alison Vredenburgh provided thoughts on potential liability for HF/E professionals, particularly in light of the relative newness of autonomous systems. The panel then turned to facilitated discussion with panelists and audience members. Specific themes included the boundaries of our responsibilities as HF/E professionals for ill-conceived or morally-objectionable systems, potential implications of manipulating user trust through design, cross-cultural perspectives on public acceptance and legal peril, and how concerns might differ by domain (e.g., medical vs. combat vs. manufacturing).

Unfortunately, recent work has suggested that even drivers with the most advanced vehicles often have little understanding of the available technology (McDonald et al., 2017). Yet, this poor understanding of advanced driver assistance systems cannot entirely be blamed on the driver; other factors, such as the availability and quality of instructional sources are also at play (e.g., Abraham et al., 2017). Facilitating access to safety-critical information and standardizing instructional and operational components are two potential routes to increase drivers’ knowledge. However, target areas must be identified. The current study reviewed the degree to which automated systems in passenger vehicles and related information varied among those moderately-priced and luxury models marketed and sold in the United States. Information regarding ten existing longitudinal (e.g., adaptive cruise control) and ten lateral control automated systems (i.e., those that provide sustained lateral control and lane centering) were gathered from OEM websites and operator manuals. Information was coded and synthesized, including the name of the system, the stated functionality, operation, and system constraints as well as the source of the information. Results of this exercise suggest a number of target areas for researchers, OEMs and policy makers to consider in attempts to increase accessibility, knowledge, and ultimately safe usage of these technologies. First, a high degree of variability was observed even among basic characteristics of these technologies such as the system name. This was particularly an issue among luxury automated longitudinal control systems where every system had a fairly different name. While the activation methods were largely consistent across both lateral and longitudinal systems, the deactivation methods varied a great deal both in the allowance of alternative methods and the type of method (if allowed). Moreover, all the systems provided some form of visual feedback to the driver, but this feedback still varied greatly, particularly among lateral systems, in the location of the feedback and the modality that supplemental feedback was presented. System limits for both automated lateral and longitudinal systems were also elucidated. The majority of OEMs reported five types of system limits: curves, stopped vehicles, weather, small obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists), and hills. Similar to the lateral control systems, two OEMs also reported difficulty handling an occupied adjacent lane. These limits were elucidated primarily through the operator manual for each respective model. While some information concerning these limits was available on the website, generally information gathered at this location was restricted. This limited accessibility to information is likely leading to individuals not getting this information, resulting in the poor understanding of these systems observed among owners and even dealers of this technology (Abraham et al., 2017; McDonald et al., 2017). When these individuals do take the time to read the operator manual and do get this information, the variability across systems likely limits their understanding and building of a mental model that supports safe usage over time as they encounter other similar systems.",,,1,,Yes,Quan Sun,"Wright, T.

The potential benefits of these technologies, such as reduction in number of crashes, enhancing driver comfort or convenience, decreasing environmental impact, etc., have been acknowledged by transportation safety researchers and federal transportation agencies. Although these systems afford safety advantages, they may also challenge the traditional role of drivers in operating vehicles. Driver acceptance, therefore, is essential for the implementation of these systems into the transportation system. Recognizing the need for research into the factors affecting driver acceptance, this study assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) for modelling driver acceptance in terms of Behavioral Intention to use an ADAS. Each of these models propose a set of factors that influence acceptance of a technology. Data collection was done using two approaches: a driving simulator approach and an online survey approach. In both approaches, participants interacted with either a fatigue monitoring system or an adaptive cruise control system combined with a lane-keeping system. Based on their experience, participants responded to several survey questions to indicate their attitude toward using the ADAS and their perception of its usefulness, usability, etc. A sample of 430 surveys were collected for this study. Results found that all the models (TAM, TPB, and UTAUT) can explain driver acceptance with their proposed sets of factors, each explaining 71% or more of the variability in Behavioral Intention.

The research was conducted from July to December 2017. Sensors’ abilities to detect pedestrians in advance of fatal collisions vary from <30% to >90% of fatalities. Combining sensor technologies offers the greatest potential for eliminating fatalities, but may be unrealistically expensive. Furthermore, whereas initial deployment of automated vehicles will likely be restricted to freeways and select urban areas, non-freeway streets and rural settings account for a substantial share of pedestrian fatalities.

Several factors including gender, vehicle type, and the presence of alcohol significantly contributed to both overestimation and underestimation. Lighting conditions also affected underestimation. Spine, thorax, and abdomen or pelvic injuries were the injuries most frequently missed by law enforcement officers.

Studies have often identified work zone crashes simply on the basis of their location and have not considered the causal role (if any) that the work zone played in the crash. This study reviewed two years of Virginia work zone crashes and identified crashes that had been directly influenced by a work zone (directly related crashes) from a data set of all crashes that had been reported as occurring in the vicinity of a work zone (coded crashes). This procedure was done to assess the degree to which work zone activities appeared to influence the likelihood or severity of crashes within the work zone. Work zone crash reports were examined individually, and crash trends and possible safety improvement measures were identified. The study found a disparity between coded crashes and directly related crashes. Only 23% of the coded crashes could be directly related to the work zone. Further, coded crashes tended to overrepresent the proportional increase in rear-end crashes and underrepresent the proportional increase in fixed object–off road crashes. Analysis also identified several potential avenues where work zone safety performance measures could be influenced by the Virginia Department of Transportation, including improved work zone traffic management planning, ingress and egress design, and traffic control placement. Improvements to work zone crash forms were also identified.

Police crash templates are designed for reporting crashes between motor vehicles, but not between vehicles/bicycles. If written/drawn bicycle-crash-scene details exist, these are not entered into spreadsheets.

Objective To assess which bicycle-crash-scene data might be added to spreadsheets for analysis.

Methods Police crash templates from 50 states were analysed. Reports for 3350 motor vehicle/bicycle crashes (2011) were obtained for the New York City area and 300 cases selected (with drawings and on roads with sharrows, bike lanes, cycle tracks and no bike provisions). Crashes were redrawn and new bicycle-crash-scene details were coded and entered into the existing spreadsheet. The association between severity of injuries and bicycle-crash-scene codes was evaluated using multiple logistic regression.

Results Police templates only consistently include pedal-cyclist and helmet. Bicycle-crash-scene coded variables for templates could include: 4 bicycle environments, 18 vehicle impact-points (opened-doors and mirrors), 4 bicycle impact-points, motor vehicle/bicycle crash patterns, in/out of the bicycle environment and bike/relevant motor vehicle categories. A test of including these variables suggested that, with bicyclists who had minor injuries as the control group, bicyclists on roads with bike lanes riding outside the lane had lower likelihood of severe injuries (OR, 0.40, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.98) compared with bicyclists riding on roads without bicycle facilities.

Conclusions Police templates should include additional bicycle-crash-scene codes for entry into spreadsheets.

Some studies considered statewide networks, but the accuracy of their secondary crash identification methods was not justified. Recently, the authors proposed an efficient method to identify secondary crashes on statewide freeway networks with reasonable accuracy. A 1-year case study was conducted for preliminary analysis. As a continuing effort, this research included four more years of secondary crash data and found that (a) rear-end and sideswipe crashes in the same direction were the top two secondary crash types; (b) road debris, construction zones, and obscured visibility were three major potential highway contributing factors; (c) following too closely, inattentive driving, losing vehicle control, and speeding were four major potential driver contributing factors; (d) temporal distributions by hour and month were different between secondary crashes and general crashes; and (e) secondary crash hot spots clustered around urban areas and were within 1 mi from major freeway interchanges. In addition, an algorithm was proposed to detect secondary crashes on the basis of police narratives in the crash reports. This algorithm was evaluated by using 5-year secondary crash data (4 years for training and 1 year for testing).

The experiences from the Decade of Action will help us to define an effective roadmap for the next decade., Vehicle safety has been one the areas that has been subjected to significant changes over the past decade with advancements in technology, especially in the field of active safety. This change in the field has been more tangible in High Income Countries (HICs). This note suggests a path to determine the effect of vehicle safety in Iran as a Low/Middle Income Country (LMIC), considering the road safety management structure of the country and introduces the priorities that need to be the subject of focus in further stages., As the “Safe System Approach for Road Safety” focuses on reducing the fatalities and injuries, the interactions between human body and the surrounding area, the vehicle becomes an important issue. Therefore, vehicle designs that meet modern safety standards, with the goal of reducing the risk of occurrence of crashes and ensuing injuries become more prominent. As these advancements in active and passive safety features are being introduced in HICs, the nature of these technologies and limited resources in LMICs, require a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of these technologies would help us set more effective strategies in such countries., A profound understanding of the causes of crashes and the following injuries, is an essential step in setting precise strategies to continue reducing fatalities. This issue has been one of the targets during the decade of action, but a structured regime with independence from involved key stakeholders, must be established to precisely determine the role and details of the involvement of vehicle design and technical aspects in occurrence of the crashes and following injuries. , As utilizing advanced technologies for upcoming future is a must to enhance the vehicle safety, considering the economic status of the country besides the evidences in the trend of crashes in Iran suggest effective interventions to achieve results in the shortest time, it would be important to examine the possibility of introducing some of the technologies in the shortest possible time, for example:, a.

To date, much of the research on AVs has focused on technological advancements with little emphasis on how this emerging technology will impact population-level health. This scoping study examines the potential health impacts of AVs based on the existing literature.; Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping protocol, we searched academic and 'grey' literature to anticipate the effects of AVs on human health.; Results: Our search captured 43 information sources that discussed a least one of the five thematic areas related to health. The bulk of the evidence is related to road safety (n = 37), followed by a relatively equal distribution between social equity (n = 24), environment (n = 22), lifestyle (n = 20), and built environment (n = 18) themes. There is general agreement that AVs will improve road safety overall, thus reducing injuries and fatalities from human errors in operating motorized vehicles. However, the relationships with air quality, physical activity, and stress, among other health factors may be more complex. The broader health implications of AVs will be dependent on how the technology is adopted in various transportation systems. Regulatory action will be a significant determinant of how AVs could affect health, as well as how AVs influence social and environmental determinants of health.; Conclusion: To support researchers and practitioners considering the health implications of AVs, we provide a conceptual map of the direct and indirect linkages between AV use and health outcomes. It is important that stakeholders, including public health agencies work to ensure that population health outcomes and equitable distribution of health impacts are priority considerations as regulators develop their response to AVs. We recommend that public health and transportation officials actively monitor trends in AV introduction and adoption, regulators focus on protecting human health and safety in AV implementation, and researchers work to expand the body of evidence surrounding AVs and population health.",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its cognitive effects can be deleterious and lead to uncomfortable or risky situations. While stress detection in this context is well developed, regulation using dedicated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is still emergent.Objectives: This systematic review focuses on stress regulation strategies that can be qualified as “subtle” or “mindless”: the technology employed to perform regulation does not interfere with an ongoing task. The review goal is 2-fold: establishing the state of the art on such technological implementation in the driving context and identifying complementary technologies relying on subtle regulation that could be applied in driving.Methods: A systematic review was conducted using search operators previously identified through a concept analysis. The patents and scientific studies selected provide an overview of actual and potential mindless technology implementations. These are then analyzed from a scientific perspective. A classification of results was performed according to the different stages of emotion regulation proposed by the Gross model.Results: A total of 47 publications were retrieved, including 21 patents and 26 studies. Six of the studies investigated mindless stress regulation in the driving context. Patents implemented strategies mostly linked to attentional deployment, while studies tended to investigate response modulation strategies.Conclusions: This review allowed us to identify several ADAS relying on mindless computing technologies to reduce stress and better understand the underlying mechanisms allowing stress reduction. Further studies are necessary to better grasp the effect of mindless technologies on driving safety.

The reported disengagements were categorized as control discrepancy, environmental conditions and other road users, hardware and software discrepancy, perception discrepancy, planning discrepancy, and operator takeover.

The disengagement initiator, whether the ADS or human operator, is linked with contributing factors, such as the location, disengagement cause, and ADS testing maturity through a random parameter binary logit model that captured unobserved heterogeneity. Results reveal that compared to freeways and interstates, the ADS has a lower likelihood of initiating the disengagement on streets and roads compared to the human operator. Likewise, software and hardware, and planning discrepancies are associated with the ADS initiating the disengagement.

It has been commonly accepted that CV or AV technologies would reduce human errors in driving and benefit traffic safety. However, the answer of how many crashes can be prevented because of CV or AV technologies has not reached a consistent conclusion. In order to quantitatively answer this question, this study used meta-analysis to evaluate the safety effectiveness of nine common and important CV or AV technologies, and tested the safety effectiveness of these technologies for six countries. First, 73 studies about the safety impact of CV or AV technologies were filtered out from 826 CAV-related papers or reports. Second, the safety impacts of these technologies with regard to assistant types and triggering times have been compared. It shows AV technologies can play a more significant role than CV technologies, and the technologies with closer triggering time to collision time have greater safety effectiveness. Third, in the meta-analysis, the random effect model was used to evaluate the safety effectiveness, and the funnel plots and trim-and-fill method were used to evaluate and adjust publication bias, so as to objectively evaluate the safety effectiveness of each technology. Then, according to the crash data of six countries, the comprehensive safety effectiveness and compilation of safety effectiveness of the above technologies were calculated. The results show that if all of technologies were implemented in the six countries, the average number of crashes could be reduced by 3.40 million, among which the India would reduce the most (54.24%). Additionally, different countries should develop different development strategies, e.g., USA should prioritize the development of the lane change warning and intersection warning, the UK should prioritize applications related to intersection warning and rear-end warning.

Although questionnaires provide the most common method for large scale fleet assessment, current questionnaires fall short in their ability to assess ADAS usage. Their main pitfall is that ADAS ownership – necessary to compute the gap between ADAS ownership and usage – is based on self-reported rather than actual ADAS ownership. In other words, it is implicitly presumed that car owners are aware of the ADAS with which their car is, or is not, equipped. To our knowledge, the presumption of awareness of ADAS ownership has not been acknowledged as a limitation in current questionnaire-based studies on ADAS usage. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to address the awareness gap by combining survey and vehicle registration analysis to assess car owners’ usage of ADAS in fleets. In this method, ADAS awareness constitutes of the difference between ADAS presence based on self-report and ADAS presence based on the vehicle specifications of participants’ own car (obtained through participants’ licence plate registration number). To test both the assumption that an awareness gap exists for ADAS as well as the feasibility of the method itself, a survey was performed under 1355 Dutch business drivers. It involved ADAS such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning and Emergency Brake. The study showed that many business drivers were unaware of with which ADAS their car is equipped and as a result, they were unable to report they own the ADAS concerned. However, drivers aware of owning a specific system generally reported that they use it. Additionally, the study revealed another group of participants: those who stated owning a specific ADAS while their vehicle specifications contradict this. In conclusion, awareness of ADAS ownership constitutes an important link that is currently missing when concatenating market penetration studies and regular questionnaires on ADAS usage. The proposed method may overcome this shortcoming, increase the validity of surveys on ADAS usage and provide large scale insights in the use of ADAS throughout an entire fleet of vehicles.",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the degree of automation in ADAS is still low nowadays, it is important to discuss the importance of human factors for the purpose of a safer implementation.",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a ‘quasi-finding’ which provides false respectability to a style of road safety management that makes the road-user the primary target of prevention actions.

Minimal attention has focused on the legal implications of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in vehicles already currently available. These can warn of external dangers, monitor driver behavior and control how a vehicle brakes, accelerates, maintains speed or position on the road. The dynamic driving task is no longer reliant simply on the physical interaction of human driver with that vehicle. Instead, the vehicle may act apart from human direction as it senses other objects in the immediate environment or monitors the human driver’s behavior or biometrics. These technological tools, which reduce the opportunity for human error, can be described as augmenting human driving capacity. Increases in safety promised by ADAS, arguably already evidenced by data, may require a reassessment of the risks posed by ‘un-augmented’ human drivers, what is now foreseeable given the data generated by ADAS and wearable driver-monitoring technology, and whether ‘un-augmented’ driving is any longer a reasonable response to that risk.",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today’s automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0–3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0–3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 %), reaction time (40 %), and lateral position (23 %). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 %), workload (20 %), and satisfaction (17 %). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 %) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 %). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.",1,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As crash report granularity increases, proper data management is critical to ensure report quality with minimal errors. States are encouraged to meet federal standards for minimum crash report elements detailed in the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria. MMUCC standardization helps states manage long-term crash data, enables multi-state analysis, and promotes sound traffic safety policies. This paper details how the states of Alabama and Wisconsin manage crash reports by evaluating their compliance with MMUCC standards as well as tracking the life cycle of crash reports in the two states from provenance, through approval and validation processes, to preservation as official records. A web-based MMUCC Compliance Tool was developed using elements from Alabama and Wisconsin crash reports, and aids other states in mapping existing crash report elements to MMUCC standards. The tool uses an automated check to map crash report elements and flags missing elements. The output of the tool includes a report detailing changes needed for the crash report to more closely align with the MMUCC standards. Common crash report lifecycle elements in Alabama and Wisconsin were identified, including initial web service validations, supervisor review, transactional database backups, linkage to driver record systems, and processes in place to manage and fix void requests.

We employed a scoping review methodology to identify the approaches used in the literature to quantify AV safety. After screening and reviewing the literature, six approaches were identified: target crash population, traffic simulation, driving simulator, road test data analysis, system failure risk assessment, and safety effectiveness estimation. We ran two evaluations on the identified approaches. First, we investigated each approach in terms of its input (required data, assumptions, etc.), output (safety evaluation metrics), and application (to estimate AVs' safety implications at the vehicle, transportation system, and society levels). Second, we qualitatively compared them in terms of three criteria: availability of input data, suitability for evaluating different automation levels, and reliability of estimations. This review identifies four challenges in AV safety evaluation: (a) shortcomings in AV safety evaluation approaches, (b) uncertainties in AV implementations and their impacts on AV safety, (c) potential riskier behavior of AV passengers as well as other road users, and (d) emerging safety issues related to AV implementations.

Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements.

Anticipatory driving is achieved through effective retrieval of prior driving-relevant knowledge using mental models and appropriate cues. Knowing when and which retrieval cues have a critical impact on the anticipation process and how information compatibility affects anticipation can be the basis for supporting people in anticipating and appropriate behavior in road traffic. For generating in-depth insights into the processing of retrieval cues, a video-based experimental study was conducted combining specific compatible and incompatible retrieval cues in urban driving scenarios. From a driver's perspective, participants were asked to anticipate in a two-step approach (measuring low and high certainty anticipation) whether a vehicle ahead would enter their lane or turn onto another street due to a lane blockage ahead. Further, they choose their preferred behavioral intention (accelerate, decelerate or maintain speed). In general, drivers strived for coherent situation representation, and in this process, multiple retrieval cues influenced anticipation in different ways. Participants were more likely to be consistent in their anticipation response. That is, they tend to follow their first intention (equivalent low and high certainty anticipation for either lane change or turn) even in the presence of incompatible stimuli. Inconsistent compared to consistent anticipation responses, however, led to reduced subjective confidence, and in part to increased criticality. Not only anticipation but also intended behavior was influenced by retrieval cues. In accordance, the anticipation of others' behaviors can be considered a predictor of specific intended behavior in road traffic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

The aim of this study is to determine whether the drivers’ presence and apparent attentiveness in a vehicle influences pedestrians’ crossing behavior, perceived behavioral control, and perceived risk, in a controlled environment, using a Head-mounted Display in an immersive Virtual Reality study. Twenty participants took part in a road-crossing experiment. The VR environment consisted of a single lane one-way road with car traffic approaching from the right-hand side of the participant which travelled at 30 kmph. Participants were asked to cross the road if they felt safe to do so. The effect of three driver conditions on pedestrians’ crossing behavior were studied: Attentive driver, distracted driver, and no driver present. Two vehicles were employed with a fixed time gap (3.5 s and 5.5 s) between them to study the effects of time gaps on pedestrians’ crossing behavior. The manipulated vehicle yielded to the pedestrians in half of the trials, stopping completely before reaching the pedestrian’s position. The crossing decision, time to initiate the crossing, crossing duration, and safety margin were measured. The main findings show that the vehicle’s motion cues (i.e. the gap between the vehicles, and the yielding behavior of the vehicle) were the most important factors affecting pedestrians’ crossing behavior. Therefore, future research should focus more on investigating how AVs should behave while interacting with pedestrians. Distracted driver condition leads to shorter crossing initiation time but the effect was small. No driver condition leads to smaller safety margin. Findings also showed that perceived behavioral control was higher and perceived risk was significantly lower when the driver appeared attentive. Given that drivers will be allowed to do other tasks while AVs are operating in the future, whether explicit communication will be needed in this situation should be further investigated.",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers generated a list of likely themes from a review of existing literature and then coded participant responses according to those themes.Results Parents who chose to introduce ADAS to their new teen drivers did so while also reporting conflicting opinions about the reliability of vehicle technologies and the impact of such systems on driving safety and skill acquisition. Many parents reported some distrust of ADAS and concerns that some features could hinder the development of good driving habits, although most participants stated that ADAS have had a positive impact on their teen drivers' safety. Opinions were split about the best point at which to introduce ADAS to teens, with half preferring introduction at the outset and half preferring to wait until the teen had mastered basic driving skills. Attitudes varied according to individual vehicle systems, with a preference for blind spot monitoring and a general dislike of lane-keeping assistance.Conclusions Specific concerns about the potential impact of ADAS on teen driving safety and skill acquisition do not prevent parents from using such systems, although the teaching strategies parents use vary according to their preferences for individual systems.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the importance of driver models for the development and assessment of active safety: a new collision warning system to make overtaking cyclists safer.

When cars and bicycles share the same lane, cars typically need to overtake them, creating dangerous conflicts—especially on rural roads, where cars travel much faster than cyclists. In order to protect cyclists, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are being developed and introduced to the market. One of them is a forward collision warning (FCW) system that helps prevent rear-end crashes by identifying and alerting drivers of threats ahead. The objective of this study is to assess the relative safety benefit of a behaviour-based (BB) FCW system that protects cyclists in a car–to–cyclist overtaking scenario. Virtual safety assessments were performed on crashes derived from naturalistic driving data. A series of driver response models was used to simulate different driver reactions to the warning. Crash frequency in conjunction with an injury risk model was used to estimate the risk of cyclist injury and fatality. The virtual safety assessment estimated that, compared to no FCW, the BB FCW could reduce cyclists’ fatalities by 53–96% and serious injuries by 43–94%, depending on the driver response model. The shorter the driver’s reaction time and the larger the driver’s deceleration, the greater the benefits of the FCW. The BB FCW also proved to be more effective than a reference FCW based on the Euro NCAP standard test protocol. The findings of this study demonstrate the BB FCW’s great potential to avoid crashes and reduce injuries in car–to–cyclist overtaking scenarios, even when the driver response model did not exceed a comfortable rate of deceleration. The results suggest that a driver behaviour model integrated into ADAS collision threat algorithms can provide substantial safety benefits.",1,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

Improving the safety relevance of automatic emergency braking testing programs: An examination of common characteristics of police-reported rear-end crashes in the United States. Traffic injury prevention, 1-6.",Improving the safety relevance of automatic emergency braking testing programs: An examination of common characteristics of police-reported rear-end crashes in the United States,1,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2022.2090544,"Objective Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems help prevent rear-end crashes where a vehicle strikes the rear of another. However, the benefits may be limited if the systems are stymied by common crash circumstances or only target scenarios evaluated in vehicle testing programs. This study examined the prevalence of characteristics that may limit AEB system performance in police-reported rear-end crashes and the relevance of scenarios used to evaluate these systems.Methods Police-reported rear-end crashes (n = 6,731,215, Crash Report Sampling System) and fatal rear-end crashes (n = 4,285, Fatality Analysis Reporting System) with a fatality in the striking or struck vehicle during 2016–2019 were analyzed. Percentages of police-reported rear-end crashes, nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and fatal rear-end crashes were computed to identify common crash characteristics. Roadway speed limit was used as a proxy for striking vehicle speed.Results A straight-moving vehicle striking a stopped or decelerating vehicle on roads with a speed limit of 40 km/h (25 mph) or less only accounted for 3% of all rear-end crashes, 3% of nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and 1% of fatal rear-end crashes. In contrast, 36% of all rear-end crashes, 36% of nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and 11% of fatal rear-end crashes involved a straight-moving vehicle striking a stopped or decelerating vehicle on roads with a speed limit between 56 and 72 km/h (35 and 45 mph). A medium or heavy truck was the struck vehicle in 32% of fatal rear-end crashes, and a motorcycle was the struck vehicle in 11% of fatal rear-end crashes. At least one of the following characteristics that may degrade AEB system performance was present in 14% of the rear-end crashes studied: striking vehicle turning; a struck vehicle turning or changing lanes; a struck vehicle that is not a passenger vehicle; wintery weather; wet or icy roads; or a speed limit of 113 km/h (70 mph) or higher.Conclusion Circumstances shown to diminish AEB effectiveness accounted for 14% of rear-end crashes, and scenarios currently used to evaluate AEB systems accounted for 3%. Evaluating AEB systems at speeds up to 72 km/h (45 mph) and incorporating a motorcycle or medium/heavy truck target will make AEB evaluations more representative of police-reported rear-end crashes.",,,2,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, user education is considered crucial. Since gamification has previously shown positive effects on learning motivation and performance, it could serve as a measure to enhance user education on automated vehicles. We developed a tablet-based instruction involving gamified elements and compared it to instruction without gamification and a control group receiving a user manual. After instruction, participants (N = 57) experienced a 30-minute automated drive on a motorway in a fixed-base driving simulator. Participants who received the gamified instruction reported a higher level of intrinsic motivation to learn the provided content. The results also indicate that gamification promotes mental model formation and trust during the automated drive. Taken together, including gamification in user education for automated driving is a promising approach to enhance safe driver-vehicle interaction.",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
