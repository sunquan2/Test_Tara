This study leveraged the MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology naturalistic driving data to identify and characterize speeding behavior across automation levels including Manual Driving, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and Pilot Assist (PA) that supports both longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. We analyzed 146 hours of motorway driving from 15 participants who each drove an instrumented vehicle for one month. Speeding prevalence, magnitude, and duration distributions were compared across automation levels using logistic mixed effect models. Findings indicated that although PA was the most prevalent driving state during free flow motorway driving, drivers were more likely to speed with ACC compared to during Manual Driving or with PA. Automation, ACC and PA, were associated with longer speeding durations and lower speeding magnitudes compared to driving manually. These findings can inform the development of automation systems that may help reduce speeding behaviors and promote safe driving.",9/1/2022,11/1/2022 15:51,11/1/2022 15:51,11/1/2022 15:51,1471-1475,,1,66,,,Speeding Behavior when Using Automation,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, based on the global trends, the role of computer-supported decision systems and artificial intelligence (AI)-based control solutions increases in relation to driving processes, which carries a significant safety-enhancing potential. To assess the possible social benefits of automated vehicle systems objectively, it is necessary to analyze the possible negative effects in detail as well. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to present a statistical survey of crashes involving automated vehicles today in order to identify and evaluate the factors that are relevant in the crashes. The analyzed data showed that when the autopilot mode was turned off and the human driver made the control decisions, the severity of crashes on straight roads was greater at $\alpha $ $=$ 0.1 significance level than when the vehicle was in autopilot mode and the vehicle system made the control decisions. In addition, if the $\alpha $ significance level is 0.2, then crashes on plain terrain, during the day, or in the speed range of 80-100 km/h are generally less serious for vehicles driven in autopilot mode than for vehicles with autopilot mode turned off. In light of the considerations above, it is also important to emphasize that this paper only investigates crash severity given occurrence but not the probability of occurrence itself.",2022,10/25/2022 14:41,10/25/2022 14:41,,10-Jan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\94FWTASE\9925988.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\664NDMPC\Török - 2022 - Do Automated Vehicles Reduce the Risk of Crashes–D.pdf,,,Automated vehicles; Safety; Accidents; Autopilot; collision causes of highly automated vehicles; crash severity of highly automated vehicles; Databases; Human factors; Reliability; risk factors; statistical data analysis; Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, this study applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to assess drivers’ intentions to use ADAS within the next month. Participants were required to have purchased a new or second-hand vehicle within the past five years and which had at least one of the following five ADAS: autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Participants (N = 217, Mage = 47.87 years, 149 male) completed a 20-minute online questionnaire. The findings revealed that 122 (56%) participants reported not seeking out any information about ADAS prior to purchasing their vehicle. Further, the most reported approaches used by participants to learn about their vehicle’s ADAS were through the owner’s manual (n = 121, 55%) and via trial and error (n = 117, 54%). It was also found that total time spent with the salesperson in explaining ADAS features did not influence drivers’ level of understanding of ADAS or number of days to adapt to the ADAS in their vehicle. However, and consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were significant positive predictors of intentions to use ADAS within the next month. It was also found that participants who learnt about these technologies either via reading the owner’s manual, trial and error, or a verbal explanation at point of sale appeared to be more frequently classified as reporting higher acceptance of ADAS than those participants who did not use those learning methods.

Previous research has highlighted that inadequate lateral distance and high vehicle speed are among the main contributing factors of crashes involving cars overtaking cyclists. A new advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) which supports drivers as they overtake cyclists was designed to avoid or, at least, mitigate crashes. In human–machine interface (HMI) design, the information was presented via multiple modalities with a multistage warning system. A combination of lateral clearance (LC) and time-to-danger (TTD) parameters was used as ADAS activation criterion. Experimentation was carried out using the medium-fidelity driving simulator at the Transportation Research Institute (IMOB) of Hasselt University in Belgium. Forty-eight drivers drove the two-lane rural experimental route two times, in baseline condition and with the ADAS activated, testing three overtaking events. Statistical tests showed that the proposed in-vehicle driving assistance system had a significant effect in increasing 1) the length of the passing phase, 2) the LC in the overtaking passing phase, and 3) the TTD along the overtaking maneuver.

In the human-centered design, an understanding of influencing factors for acceptance and usage is crucial to align in-vehicle technology with the user needs. Addressing the underlying psychological processes, this work modelled drivers’ usage intentions with motivational regulations (SDT), the TAM, and the UTAUT. An online study with 319 German drivers was conducted examining drivers’ positive or negative experiences with assistance and infotainment systems in the vehicle.

However, the benefits may be limited if the systems are stymied by common crash circumstances or only target scenarios evaluated in vehicle testing programs. This study examined the prevalence of characteristics that may limit AEB system performance in police-reported rear-end crashes and the relevance of scenarios used to evaluate these systems.Methods Police-reported rear-end crashes (n = 6,731,215, Crash Report Sampling System) and fatal rear-end crashes (n = 4,285, Fatality Analysis Reporting System) with a fatality in the striking or struck vehicle during 2016–2019 were analyzed. Percentages of police-reported rear-end crashes, nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and fatal rear-end crashes were computed to identify common crash characteristics. Roadway speed limit was used as a proxy for striking vehicle speed.Results A straight-moving vehicle striking a stopped or decelerating vehicle on roads with a speed limit of 40 km/h (25 mph) or less only accounted for 3% of all rear-end crashes, 3% of nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and 1% of fatal rear-end crashes. In contrast, 36% of all rear-end crashes, 36% of nonfatal-injury rear-end crashes, and 11% of fatal rear-end crashes involved a straight-moving vehicle striking a stopped or decelerating vehicle on roads with a speed limit between 56 and 72 km/h (35 and 45 mph). A medium or heavy truck was the struck vehicle in 32% of fatal rear-end crashes, and a motorcycle was the struck vehicle in 11% of fatal rear-end crashes. At least one of the following characteristics that may degrade AEB system performance was present in 14% of the rear-end crashes studied: striking vehicle turning; a struck vehicle turning or changing lanes; a struck vehicle that is not a passenger vehicle; wintery weather; wet or icy roads; or a speed limit of 113 km/h (70 mph) or higher.Conclusion Circumstances shown to diminish AEB effectiveness accounted for 14% of rear-end crashes, and scenarios currently used to evaluate AEB systems accounted for 3%. Evaluating AEB systems at speeds up to 72 km/h (45 mph) and incorporating a motorcycle or medium/heavy truck target will make AEB evaluations more representative of police-reported rear-end crashes.",6/29/2022,7/5/2022 16:05,10/11/2022 21:54,7/5/2022 16:05,6-Jan,,0,0,,,Improving the safety relevance of automatic emergency braking testing programs,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2022.2090544 PMID: 35767826,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\EGCSUZU4\Kidd - 2022 - Improving the safety relevance of automatic emerge.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\HEQAMH2P\15389588.2022.html,,Include,accidents; automatic emergency braking; fatal crashes; motor vehicles; police-reported crashes; Rear-end crashes; traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADAS place powerful, yet imperfect, automation in the hands of drivers who hold both misconceptions and reservations about ADAS. There is little previous research on drivers’ knowledge of ADAS, and even less on sources of information drivers use to inform their knowledge. The present study addressed this gap, testing hypotheses about influences on understanding of seven ADAS in 634 licensed US drivers (aged 18–82). Multiple regression to predict self-assessed driver characteristics revealed: (a) Drivers who rated themselves as more technically sophisticated tended to be young and male, to be at once less objectively knowledgeable and more confident of their knowledge of ADAS, to avoid car dealers for ADAS information, and to value brand status; (b) Drivers who rated themselves as faster to adopt new technology also tended to be male but to be more objectively knowledgeable about ADAS and to prefer learning about ADAS from owner manuals; (c) Drivers who rated themselves as more confident in using novel vehicle technology tended to be young males with greater objective knowledge of ADAS who valued “hands-on” ADAS experience; (d) Drivers who rated themselves as more concerned about vehicle safety tended to be female, to value crash data, and to rely on hands-on experience to learn about ADAS; (e) Drivers who rated themselves as having greater aesthetic concerns tended to rely on information on styles, colors, wheels when buying a new car and preferred specific ADAS components. Neither of the latter two differed in objective ADAS knowledge. These results make a novel contribution in revealing how driver demographics and characteristics are related to preference for specific sources of information on ADAS and objective knowledge of ADAS.

When cars and bicycles share the same lane, cars typically need to overtake them, creating dangerous conflicts—especially on rural roads, where cars travel much faster than cyclists. In order to protect cyclists, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are being developed and introduced to the market. One of them is a forward collision warning (FCW) system that helps prevent rear-end crashes by identifying and alerting drivers of threats ahead. The objective of this study is to assess the relative safety benefit of a behaviour-based (BB) FCW system that protects cyclists in a car–to–cyclist overtaking scenario. Virtual safety assessments were performed on crashes derived from naturalistic driving data. A series of driver response models was used to simulate different driver reactions to the warning. Crash frequency in conjunction with an injury risk model was used to estimate the risk of cyclist injury and fatality. The virtual safety assessment estimated that, compared to no FCW, the BB FCW could reduce cyclists’ fatalities by 53–96% and serious injuries by 43–94%, depending on the driver response model. The shorter the driver’s reaction time and the larger the driver’s deceleration, the greater the benefits of the FCW. The BB FCW also proved to be more effective than a reference FCW based on the Euro NCAP standard test protocol. The findings of this study demonstrate the BB FCW’s great potential to avoid crashes and reduce injuries in car–to–cyclist overtaking scenarios, even when the driver response model did not exceed a comfortable rate of deceleration. The results suggest that a driver behaviour model integrated into ADAS collision threat algorithms can provide substantial safety benefits.",2/1/2022,1/10/2022 16:31,10/11/2022 21:51,1/10/2022 16:31,106513,,,165,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,On the importance of driver models for the development and assessment of active safety,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\V5LCHIIA\Kovaceva et al. - 2022 - On the importance of driver models for the develop.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\CH6BUJ5A\S0001457521005443.html,,Include,Active safety systems; Counterfactual simulations; Cyclist; Injuries; Naturalistic driving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been little research on how these drivers use ADAS, as most only have access to these systems in their parents’ vehicles when learning to drive because teens tend to drive older, less expensive vehicles when driving independently. This study examined how parental attitudes toward ADAS influence how and when parents introduce their teens to these systems when teaching them to drive.Methods Three web-based focus groups were conducted with parents who owned ADAS-equipped vehicles and who either had a teen with either a learner permit or a teen who recently began driving independently. The moderator-led discussion examined participant attitudes about teen driving risk, the perceived benefits or risks associated with teen use of ADAS, and parents’ teaching strategies for ADAS. Researchers generated a list of likely themes from a review of existing literature and then coded participant responses according to those themes.Results Parents who chose to introduce ADAS to their new teen drivers did so while also reporting conflicting opinions about the reliability of vehicle technologies and the impact of such systems on driving safety and skill acquisition. Many parents reported some distrust of ADAS and concerns that some features could hinder the development of good driving habits, although most participants stated that ADAS have had a positive impact on their teen drivers' safety. Opinions were split about the best point at which to introduce ADAS to teens, with half preferring introduction at the outset and half preferring to wait until the teen had mastered basic driving skills. Attitudes varied according to individual vehicle systems, with a preference for blind spot monitoring and a general dislike of lane-keeping assistance.Conclusions Specific concerns about the potential impact of ADAS on teen driving safety and skill acquisition do not prevent parents from using such systems, although the teaching strategies parents use vary according to their preferences for individual systems.",1/2/2022,7/23/2022 18:57,10/11/2022 21:50,7/23/2022 18:57,5-Jan,,1,23,,,Learning to drive,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2021.2004401 PMID: 34874803,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\Z9JEQ92G\15389588.2021.html,,Include,Adolescent drivers; crash avoidance; driver education; supervised practice driving; vehicle technologies; young drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Active parental oversight can improve teen driving safety, and several manufacturers have released teen-focused safety features over the past decade. Still, parents don't always use these systems and often don't even know their vehicle is equipped. A recent survey found that parents who do know about such systems on their vehicle first learned of them from a salesperson at a dealership. The current study examined how salespeople discuss and sell teen-specific safety systems on vehicles to parents shopping for a new teen driver. METHODS: The study focused on four vehicle brands. Two researchers posed as the parents of a new teen driver who were shopping for a vehicle for their teen. They entered dealerships and conducted semistructured interviews with the salesperson that approached them, using prompts of increasing specificity about their teen driver and their interest in safety, and tracking at what point each salesperson mentioned their brand's teen-specific systems, what features they mentioned, and how accurate those mentions were. RESULTS: Thirty of the 40 participating salespeople were able to mention their brand's teen-specific system at some point during the procedure. Hyundai salespeople most consistently brought up their brand's teen features, and Chevy salespeople mentioned the most features while Ford salespeople mentioned the fewest. Salespeople often mentioned speed-related features, although the most commonly mentioned features varied by brand. No participating salespeople reported receiving training specifically about their brand's teen features. DISCUSSION: Most salespeople approached did mention their brand's teen-focused safety systems, but did not usually do so until they had received more targeted prompts. Information these salespeople did share was often vague and general. Salespeople are a key source of information about a vehicle's specific and relevant safety features, and parents without at least some vague preexisting knowledge about the systems or features that could be available on a vehicle of interest are not likely to leave a dealership with a clear idea of all available features that could aid their efforts to keep their teen drivers safe.",2022,3/20/2022 23:55,10/11/2022 21:48,,10-Jun,,1,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dimensions,,PMID: 34874795,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\4I86DBD6\15389588.2021.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\ZLESR29D\Weast 等 - 2022 - Salesperson knowledge of teen-specific vehicle saf.pdf,,Exclude,parental monitoring; Teen drivers; vehicle safety systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to determine whether the drivers’ presence and apparent attentiveness in a vehicle influences pedestrians’ crossing behavior, perceived behavioral control, and perceived risk, in a controlled environment, using a Head-mounted Display in an immersive Virtual Reality study. Twenty participants took part in a road-crossing experiment. The VR environment consisted of a single lane one-way road with car traffic approaching from the right-hand side of the participant which travelled at 30 kmph. Participants were asked to cross the road if they felt safe to do so. The effect of three driver conditions on pedestrians’ crossing behavior were studied: Attentive driver, distracted driver, and no driver present. Two vehicles were employed with a fixed time gap (3.5 s and 5.5 s) between them to study the effects of time gaps on pedestrians’ crossing behavior. The manipulated vehicle yielded to the pedestrians in half of the trials, stopping completely before reaching the pedestrian’s position. The crossing decision, time to initiate the crossing, crossing duration, and safety margin were measured. The main findings show that the vehicle’s motion cues (i.e. the gap between the vehicles, and the yielding behavior of the vehicle) were the most important factors affecting pedestrians’ crossing behavior. Therefore, future research should focus more on investigating how AVs should behave while interacting with pedestrians. Distracted driver condition leads to shorter crossing initiation time but the effect was small. No driver condition leads to smaller safety margin. Findings also showed that perceived behavioral control was higher and perceived risk was significantly lower when the driver appeared attentive. Given that drivers will be allowed to do other tasks while AVs are operating in the future, whether explicit communication will be needed in this situation should be further investigated.",12/1/2021,10/5/2021 21:30,10/11/2022 21:38,10/5/2021 21:30,100466,,,12,,Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,Will pedestrians cross the road before an automated vehicle?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\MFHWQTTM\S2590198221001718.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\UHKXF34F\Nuñez Velasco et al. - 2021 - Will pedestrians cross the road before an automate.pdf,,Discuss,Automated vehicles; Driver attentiveness; Driver presence; Virtual reality; Vulnerable road users,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anticipatory driving is achieved through effective retrieval of prior driving-relevant knowledge using mental models and appropriate cues. Knowing when and which retrieval cues have a critical impact on the anticipation process and how information compatibility affects anticipation can be the basis for supporting people in anticipating and appropriate behavior in road traffic. For generating in-depth insights into the processing of retrieval cues, a video-based experimental study was conducted combining specific compatible and incompatible retrieval cues in urban driving scenarios. From a driver's perspective, participants were asked to anticipate in a two-step approach (measuring low and high certainty anticipation) whether a vehicle ahead would enter their lane or turn onto another street due to a lane blockage ahead. Further, they choose their preferred behavioral intention (accelerate, decelerate or maintain speed). In general, drivers strived for coherent situation representation, and in this process, multiple retrieval cues influenced anticipation in different ways. Participants were more likely to be consistent in their anticipation response. That is, they tend to follow their first intention (equivalent low and high certainty anticipation for either lane change or turn) even in the presence of incompatible stimuli. Inconsistent compared to consistent anticipation responses, however, led to reduced subjective confidence, and in part to increased criticality. Not only anticipation but also intended behavior was influenced by retrieval cues. In accordance, the anticipation of others' behaviors can be considered a predictor of specific intended behavior in road traffic.",11/1/2021,11/16/2021 15:30,10/11/2022 21:38,11/16/2021 15:30,252-265,,,83,,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,From anticipation to behavioral intention,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\VZ5IV6C9\Mühl et al. - 2021 - From anticipation to behavioral intention Insight.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\PBEZHR4G\S1369847821002424.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\F6SFSE5B\S1369847821002424.html,,Exclude,Anticipation; Cognitive processing; Driving behavior; Knowledge representation; Situation awareness; Traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, aesthetic responses to built and natural environments reduce to a few underlying psychological dimensions. Second, we hypothesized greater consistency in aesthetic appraisals to natural than built environments. Using techniques from network science, we found that responses to images of exterior architecture and natural landscapes were derived from three psychological dimensions: Fascination (a scene's richness and interest), Coherence (analytic judgements about a scene's organization and construction), and Hominess (feelings of warmth or coziness). Notably, however, subsequent exploratory analyses indicated some differences in psychological responses across contexts. For example, Hominess was associated with greater naturalness for the built environments, but homier natural landscapes were more ordered. We also found less variability in responses to natural landscapes, consistent with our second hypothesis. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Fascination, Coherence, and Hominess are broadly applicable aesthetic experiences induced by one's surrounding environment.

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are driving control systems that have been found to improve civilian drivers’ safety; however, the impact of ADAS on police officers’ driving safety has yet to be investigated thoroughly. Disparities between driver states and tasks performed while driving between police and civilian drivers necessitate this distinction. This study identified the types of ADAS used in police vehicles, their impact on officers’ safety, and proposed potential future ADAS features to be implemented in police vehicles. A systematic literature review was conducted using Google Scholar, Compendex, Web of Science, Transport Research International Documentation (TRID), and Google Patents databases to identify the most prevalent police vehicles used in the U.S., available ADAS features in those vehicles, and the impact of ADAS on officers’ safety.

Background Drivers may become inattentive when using partially-automated driving systems. The safety effects associated with inattention are unknown until we have a quantitative reference on how visual behavior changes with automation. Methods The model is based on glance data from 290 human initiated AP disengagement epochs. Glance duration and transition were modelled with Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed models. Results The model replicates the observed glance pattern across drivers. The model’s components show that off-road glances were longer with AP active than without and that their frequency characteristics changed. Driving-related off-road glances were less frequent with AP active than in manual driving, while non-driving related glances to the down/center-stack areas were the most frequent and the longest (22% of the glances exceeded 2 s). Little difference was found in on-road glance duration. Conclusion Visual behavior patterns change before and after AP disengagement. Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.

Some of the most popular ADAS include blind spot monitoring and cruise control which are fitted in the majority of new vehicles sold in high-income countries. With more drivers having access to these technologies, it is imperative to develop policy and strategies to guarantee the safe uptake of ADAS. One key issue is that ADAS education has been primarily centred on the user manual which are not widely utilised. Moreover, it is unclear if user manuals are an adequate source of education in terms of content and readability. To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in ADAS-related content and readability among the manuals of the highest selling vehicles in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are seven themes in the user manuals: differences between driving with and without ADAS, familiarisation requirements, operational limits of the ADAS, potential ADAS errors, behaviour adaptation warnings, confusion warnings, and malfunction warnings. The quantitative analysis found that some of the manuals require several years of education above the recommended for a universal audience (>8 years) to be understood. Additionally, there is a notable number of text diversions and infographics which could make comprehension of the user manual difficult. This investigation shows that there is a lack of standardisation of ADAS user manuals (in both content and delivery of information) which requires regulatory oversight.

This study is designed to identify the AV safety quantification studies, evaluate the quantification approaches used in the literature, and uncover the gaps and challenges in AV safety evaluation. We employed a scoping review methodology to identify the approaches used in the literature to quantify AV safety. After screening and reviewing the literature, six approaches were identified: target crash population, traffic simulation, driving simulator, road test data analysis, system failure risk assessment, and safety effectiveness estimation. We ran two evaluations on the identified approaches. First, we investigated each approach in terms of its input (required data, assumptions, etc.), output (safety evaluation metrics), and application (to estimate AVs' safety implications at the vehicle, transportation system, and society levels). Second, we qualitatively compared them in terms of three criteria: availability of input data, suitability for evaluating different automation levels, and reliability of estimations. This review identifies four challenges in AV safety evaluation: (a) shortcomings in AV safety evaluation approaches, (b) uncertainties in AV implementations and their impacts on AV safety, (c) potential riskier behavior of AV passengers as well as other road users, and (d) emerging safety issues related to AV implementations.

However, under dynamic traffic conditions, especially for dense-vehicle scenarios, the naive beaconing scheme where vehicles broadcast beacons at a fixed rate with a fixed transmission power can cause severe channel congestion and thus degrade the beaconing reliability. In this paper, by considering the kinematic status and beaconing rate together, we study the rear-end collision risk and define a danger coefficient ρ to capture the danger threat of each vehicle being in the rear-end collision. In specific, we propose a fully distributed adaptive beacon control scheme, called ABC, which makes each vehicle actively adopt a minimal but sufficient beaconing rate to avoid the rear-end collision in dense scenarios based on individually estimated ρ. With ABC, vehicles can broadcast at the maximum beaconing rate when the channel medium resource is enough and meanwhile keep identifying whether the channel is congested. Once a congestion event is detected, an NP-hard distributed beacon rate adaptation (DBRA) problem is solved with a greedy heuristic algorithm, in which a vehicle with a higher ρ is assigned with a higher beaconing rate while keeping the total required beaconing demand lower than the channel capacity. We prove the heuristic algorithm's close proximity to the optimal result and thoroughly analyze the communication overhead of ABC scheme. By using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)-generated vehicular traces, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed ABC scheme. Simulation results show that vehicles can adapt beaconing rates according to the driving safety demand, and the beaconing reliability can be guaranteed even under high-dense vehicle scenarios.",2021-02,2/28/2022 22:15,10/11/2022 20:58,,1248-1263,,2,22,,,Towards Rear-End Collision Avoidance,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\48B675DK\8966614.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\5FI8PX8F\Lyu et al. - 2021 - Towards Rear-End Collision Avoidance Adaptive Bea.pdf,,Exclude,Safety; Accidents; Reliability; Adaptation models; adaptive beaconing; Bandwidth; beacon congestion control; Heuristic algorithms; rear-end collision avoidance; safety-awareness; V2X; Vehicle-to-everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By designing a function that captures the initial and maximum risk-level of drivers when involved in a critical driving event while driving on a field operational test (FOT) route in Wuhan China; a comparison of the risk-level of drivers when ADAS was on as against when ADAS was off can be made, enabling an effective evaluation of the impact of ADAS on driver’s risk perception and consequent risk mitigation.

Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials.

An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today’s automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0–3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0–3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 %), reaction time (40 %), and lateral position (23 %). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 %), workload (20 %), and satisfaction (17 %). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 %) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 %). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.",11/1/2020,4/30/2022 16:08,10/11/2022 20:45,4/30/2022 16:08,105741,,,147,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,Advanced vehicle technologies and road safety,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\AGE4ITJA\Furlan et al. - 2020 - Advanced vehicle technologies and road safety A s.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\9EK7MQ5I\S000145752031561X.html,,Include,Driving; Advanced driver assistance systems; Advanced vehicle technologies; Age; Drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, the vehicle may act apart from human direction as it senses other objects in the immediate environment or monitors the human driver’s behavior or biometrics.

Studies indicate that media and marketing descriptions of vehicle automation affect user perceptions of asystem's capabilities, and later their interaction with the system.

The lack of public awareness of this issue is one of the most critical problems impacting trust calibration and the safe use of vehicle automation.

Although questionnaires provide the most common method for large scale fleet assessment, current questionnaires fall short in their ability to assess ADAS usage. Their main pitfall is that ADAS ownership – necessary to compute the gap between ADAS ownership and usage – is based on self-reported rather than actual ADAS ownership. In other words, it is implicitly presumed that car owners are aware of the ADAS with which their car is, or is not, equipped. To our knowledge, the presumption of awareness of ADAS ownership has not been acknowledged as a limitation in current questionnaire-based studies on ADAS usage. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to address the awareness gap by combining survey and vehicle registration analysis to assess car owners’ usage of ADAS in fleets. In this method, ADAS awareness constitutes of the difference between ADAS presence based on self-report and ADAS presence based on the vehicle specifications of participants’ own car (obtained through participants’ licence plate registration number). To test both the assumption that an awareness gap exists for ADAS as well as the feasibility of the method itself, a survey was performed under 1355 Dutch business drivers. It involved ADAS such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning and Emergency Brake. The study showed that many business drivers were unaware of with which ADAS their car is equipped and as a result, they were unable to report they own the ADAS concerned. However, drivers aware of owning a specific system generally reported that they use it. Additionally, the study revealed another group of participants: those who stated owning a specific ADAS while their vehicle specifications contradict this. In conclusion, awareness of ADAS ownership constitutes an important link that is currently missing when concatenating market penetration studies and regular questionnaires on ADAS usage. The proposed method may overcome this shortcoming, increase the validity of surveys on ADAS usage and provide large scale insights in the use of ADAS throughout an entire fleet of vehicles.",4/1/2020,3/20/2022 23:58,10/11/2022 20:39,3/20/2022 23:58,65-77,,,134,,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,Addressing the awareness gap,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\GX98E2NH\Harms et al. - 2020 - Addressing the awareness gap A combined survey an.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\XP7LC4CW\S0965856418315817.html,,Include,Advanced driver assistance system (ADAS); Awareness; Business driver; Consumer behaviour; Hidden functionality; Research methodology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been commonly accepted that CV or AV technologies would reduce human errors in driving and benefit traffic safety. However, the answer of how many crashes can be prevented because of CV or AV technologies has not reached a consistent conclusion. In order to quantitatively answer this question, this study used meta-analysis to evaluate the safety effectiveness of nine common and important CV or AV technologies, and tested the safety effectiveness of these technologies for six countries. First, 73 studies about the safety impact of CV or AV technologies were filtered out from 826 CAV-related papers or reports. Second, the safety impacts of these technologies with regard to assistant types and triggering times have been compared. It shows AV technologies can play a more significant role than CV technologies, and the technologies with closer triggering time to collision time have greater safety effectiveness. Third, in the meta-analysis, the random effect model was used to evaluate the safety effectiveness, and the funnel plots and trim-and-fill method were used to evaluate and adjust publication bias, so as to objectively evaluate the safety effectiveness of each technology. Then, according to the crash data of six countries, the comprehensive safety effectiveness and compilation of safety effectiveness of the above technologies were calculated. The results show that if all of technologies were implemented in the six countries, the average number of crashes could be reduced by 3.40 million, among which the India would reduce the most (54.24%).

A more comprehensive understanding of the ADS safety performances can be established through the California Department of Motor Vehicle disengagement and crash reports. This study comprehensively examines the safety performances (159,840 disengagements, 124 crashes, and 3,669,472 automated vehicle miles traveled by the manufacturers) documented since the inauguration of the testing program. The reported disengagements were categorized as control discrepancy, environmental conditions and other road users, hardware and software discrepancy, perception discrepancy, planning discrepancy, and operator takeover. An applicable subset of disengagements was then used to identify and quantify the 5 W’s of these safety-critical events: who (disengagement initiator), when (the maturity of the ADS), where (location of disengagement), and what/why (the facts causing the disengagement). The disengagement initiator, whether the ADS or human operator, is linked with contributing factors, such as the location, disengagement cause, and ADS testing maturity through a random parameter binary logit model that captured unobserved heterogeneity. Results reveal that compared to freeways and interstates, the ADS has a lower likelihood of initiating the disengagement on streets and roads compared to the human operator. Likewise, software and hardware, and planning discrepancies are associated with the ADS initiating the disengagement. As the ADS testing maturity advances in months, the probability of the disengagement being initiated by the ADS marginally increases when compared to human-initiated. Overall, the study contributes by understanding the factors associated with disengagements and exploring their implications for automated systems.",3/1/2020,4/30/2022 16:08,10/11/2022 20:38,4/30/2022 16:08,105406,,,136,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,"C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\CIIEEP82\Boggs et al. - 2020 - Exploring the who, what, when, where, and why of a.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\KIPFZ69R\S000145751931019X.html",,Exclude,Automated vehicles; California Department of Motor Vehicle; Disengagements; Random parameter binary logit; Safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiences from the Decade of Action will help us to define an effective roadmap for the next decade., Vehicle safety has been one the areas that has been subjected to significant changes over the past decade with advancements in technology, especially in the field of active safety. This change in the field has been more tangible in High Income Countries (HICs). This note suggests a path to determine the effect of vehicle safety in Iran as a Low/Middle Income Country (LMIC), considering the road safety management structure of the country and introduces the priorities that need to be the subject of focus in further stages., As the “Safe System Approach for Road Safety” focuses on reducing the fatalities and injuries, the interactions between human body and the surrounding area, the vehicle becomes an important issue. Therefore, vehicle designs that meet modern safety standards, with the goal of reducing the risk of occurrence of crashes and ensuing injuries become more prominent. As these advancements in active and passive safety features are being introduced in HICs, the nature of these technologies and limited resources in LMICs, require a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of these technologies would help us set more effective strategies in such countries., A profound understanding of the causes of crashes and the following injuries, is an essential step in setting precise strategies to continue reducing fatalities. This issue has been one of the targets during the decade of action, but a structured regime with independence from involved key stakeholders, must be established to precisely determine the role and details of the involvement of vehicle design and technical aspects in occurrence of the crashes and following injuries. , As utilizing advanced technologies for upcoming future is a must to enhance the vehicle safety, considering the economic status of the country besides the evidences in the trend of crashes in Iran suggest effective interventions to achieve results in the shortest time, it would be important to examine the possibility of introducing some of the technologies in the shortest possible time, for example:, a. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) ratings for new car models., b. ABS/Combined Braking systems and daytime running lights for powered two-wheelers., c.

To date, much of the research on AVs has focused on technological advancements with little emphasis on how this emerging technology will impact population-level health. This scoping study examines the potential health impacts of AVs based on the existing literature.; Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping protocol, we searched academic and 'grey' literature to anticipate the effects of AVs on human health.; Results: Our search captured 43 information sources that discussed a least one of the five thematic areas related to health. The bulk of the evidence is related to road safety (n = 37), followed by a relatively equal distribution between social equity (n = 24), environment (n = 22), lifestyle (n = 20), and built environment (n = 18) themes. There is general agreement that AVs will improve road safety overall, thus reducing injuries and fatalities from human errors in operating motorized vehicles. However, the relationships with air quality, physical activity, and stress, among other health factors may be more complex. The broader health implications of AVs will be dependent on how the technology is adopted in various transportation systems. Regulatory action will be a significant determinant of how AVs could affect health, as well as how AVs influence social and environmental determinants of health.; Conclusion: To support researchers and practitioners considering the health implications of AVs, we provide a conceptual map of the direct and indirect linkages between AV use and health outcomes. It is important that stakeholders, including public health agencies work to ensure that population health outcomes and equitable distribution of health impacts are priority considerations as regulators develop their response to AVs.

Many experts expect that advances in automated vehicle technology will reduce pedestrian fatalities substantially through eliminating crashes caused by human error. This paper investigates automated vehicles’ potential for reducing pedestrian fatalities by analyzing nearly 5,000 pedestrian fatalities recorded in 2015 in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, virtually reconstructing them under a hypothetical scenario that replaces involved vehicles with automated versions equipped with state-of-the-art (as of December 2017) sensor technology. Methods This research involved the following activities: (1) establish functional ranges of state-of-the-art pedestrian sensor technologies, (2) use data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to identify pedestrian fatalities recorded in each state in the U.S. and District of Columbia in 2015, and (3) assess the maximum numbers of pedestrian fatalities that could have been avoided had involved vehicles been replaced with autonomous versions equipped with the described sensors. The research was conducted from July to December 2017. Results Sensors’ abilities to detect pedestrians in advance of fatal collisions vary from <30% to >90% of fatalities. Combining sensor technologies offers the greatest potential for eliminating fatalities, but may be unrealistically expensive. Furthermore, whereas initial deployment of automated vehicles will likely be restricted to freeways and select urban areas, non-freeway streets and rural settings account for a substantial share of pedestrian fatalities. Conclusions Although technologies are being developed for automated vehicles to successfully detect pedestrians in advance of most fatal collisions, the current costs and operating conditions of those technologies substantially decrease the potential for automated vehicles to radically reduce pedestrian fatalities in the short term.",1/1/2019,9/22/2021 15:21,10/11/2022 19:33,10/5/2021 17:06,7-Jan,,1,56,,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,Automated Vehicles and Pedestrian Safety,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\PHNEWVDM\Combs et al. - 2019 - Automated Vehicles and Pedestrian Safety Explorin.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\2Q8CQVUS\Combs et al. - 2019 - Automated Vehicles and Pedestrian Safety Explorin.pdf; ; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\7G32ZPI8\S0749379718320932.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\LZUTTZSR\fulltext.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337236,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, drivers are missing out on features that, although costly, could possibly save their lives.Few new-car buyers bother to try out so-called advanced driver assist systems, which include automatic braking, lane-keeping aids and adaptive cruise control — technology proven to keep drivers safer. A recent McKinsey & Company study estimates 70 per cent of car shoppers are aware of such features, but only a third try them out on a test drive.Shoppers lack detailed knowledge of advanced safety packages partly because many dealers don’t stock cars with the software-driven options, which can add as much as $US6000 ($7921) to the base price.Many salespeople would rather focus on selling more cars than spend time explaining safety technology to customers, researchers say. That is partly because they aren’t well-versed in how the technologies work.Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab researchers recently polled dealer salespeople and found six of the 17 interviewed could properly explain the technology.“Ultimately, it seemed to come down to lack of training, high turnover and the expectation of more work post-sale,” said Hillary Abraham, one of the study’s authors. She said that even if a customer opted for a car with the technology, the salesperson was less likely to explain the safety features as there is no financial gain.The Boston Consulting Group estimates that about 30 per cent of traffic fatalities could be reduced if all new cars had a standard advanced safety package. US vehicle deaths remained near decade-highs in 2017, topping 40,000 for the second year in a row, according to the National Safety Council.The average customer spends at least two hours at a dealership when buying a car, but most of that time is devoted to setting up financing, according to a J.D. Power survey. Customers spend less than 30 minutes taking delivery of the vehicle, during which time a salesperson explains the features.Recognising that salespeople don’t have time to explain all the new technology that cars offer today, from Bluetooth to advanced safety packages, dealers like Quirk Ford outside Boston are using teenagers to inform the customer after the sale has been made. General Manager Mike Quirk said he thought of using the group of 10 teenagers after realising that salespeople would rush through the process.“Technology is constantly changing, and it’s a time-consuming process (to explain),” Mr Quirk said. “We found that in the sales process you don’t have time to do that.” For car manufacturers weathering an industry downturn, the relative lack of adoption of safety packages means they are losing out on an opportunity to increase per-car margins. Car companies could force greater adoption of safety features if they make them more affordable or include them in the price of new cars, analysts say.However, mass-market automakers such as Honda, Subaru and Toyota are making their safety packages standard on models such as the 2019 Subaru Ascent, 2018 Honda Accord and the 2018 Toyota Camry.Luxury-car brands typically include advanced safety gear in their offerings. Among mass-market brands, Nissan is one of the first to make its driver-safety package a standard feature.Dan Mohnke, Nissan’s head of sales in North America, said he realised the benefits of the company’s advanced safety offering, called ProPilot Assist, weren’t being communicated effectively.“We’re working on an ‘invertising’ program just with our employees and our dealers, just from a standpoint of getting everyone to understand the technologies that we have and the advantage that those technologies bring,” he said.",5/23/2018,9/22/2021 15:21,10/11/2022 19:32,5/16/2021 17:22,23,,,,,"Australian, The",,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: News Limited Australia,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper uses the principles of Schema Theory and the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) to further explore the circumstances surrounding the fatal Tesla crash in May 2016 in which the driver was fatally injured using team-PCM representations. The preliminary National Highway Traffic Safety Administration accident investigation concluded that the driver of the Tesla Model S was at fault. However, the analysis presented in this paper argues that rather than “driver error”, the underlying cause of this tragic incident could be in fact more akin to a “designer error” implicating the design of the Autopilot feature itself. This is in line with the National Transportation Safety Boards more recent announcement that suggests systems design may have contributed to the crash. It would therefore appear that the drivers expectation of system functionality may not have matched the real life capabilities of the system. This is likely to be a product of inappropriate mental models relating to system function.",10/1/2018,10/28/2021 16:22,10/11/2022 19:31,10/28/2021 16:22,278-285,,,108,,,Driver error or designer error,,,,,,,en,,,,,www-sciencedirect-com.srv-proxy1.library.tamu.edu,,Publisher: Elsevier,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\BXCY6B5G\S0925753517314212.html,,Discuss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary countermeasure to reduce the occurrence of such crashes is the installation of a median barrier. When installation of a median barrier is warranted, transportation agencies are faced with the decision among various alternatives including concrete barriers, beam guardrail, or high-tension cable barriers. Each barrier type differs in terms of its deflection characteristics upon impact, the required installation and maintenance costs, and the roadway characteristics (e.g., median width) where installation would be feasible. This study involved an investigation of barrier performance through an in-depth analysis of crash frequency and severity data from freeway segments where high-tension cable, thrie-beam, and concrete median barriers were installed. A comprehensive manual review of crash reports was conducted to identify crashes in which a vehicle left the roadway and encroached into the median. This review also involved an examination of crash outcomes when a barrier strike occurred, which included vehicle containment, penetration, or re-direction onto the travel lanes. The manual review of crash reports provided critical supplementary information through narratives and diagrams not normally available through standard fields on police crash report forms. Statistical models were estimated to identify factors that affect the frequency, severity, and outcomes of median-related crashes, with particular emphases on differences between segments with varying median barrier types. Several roadway-, traffic-, and environmental-related characteristics were found to affect these metrics, with results varying across the different barrier types. The results of this study provide transportation agencies with important guidance as to the in-service performance of various types of median barrier.",2018,5/8/2022 23:08,10/11/2022 17:03,,216-224,,,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISBN: 0001-4575 Publisher: Elsevier,,,,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential benefits of these technologies, such as reduction in number of crashes, enhancing driver comfort or convenience, decreasing environmental impact, etc., have been acknowledged by transportation safety researchers and federal transportation agencies. Although these systems afford safety advantages, they may also challenge the traditional role of drivers in operating vehicles. Driver acceptance, therefore, is essential for the implementation of these systems into the transportation system. Recognizing the need for research into the factors affecting driver acceptance, this study assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) for modelling driver acceptance in terms of Behavioral Intention to use an ADAS. Each of these models propose a set of factors that influence acceptance of a technology. Data collection was done using two approaches: a driving simulator approach and an online survey approach. In both approaches, participants interacted with either a fatigue monitoring system or an adaptive cruise control system combined with a lane-keeping system. Based on their experience, participants responded to several survey questions to indicate their attitude toward using the ADAS and their perception of its usefulness, usability, etc. A sample of 430 surveys were collected for this study. Results found that all the models (TAM, TPB, and UTAUT) can explain driver acceptance with their proposed sets of factors, each explaining 71% or more of the variability in Behavioral Intention. Among the models, TAM was found to perform the best in modelling driver acceptance followed by TPB.

Unfortunately, recent work has suggested that even drivers with the most advanced vehicles often have little understanding of the available technology (McDonald et al., 2017). Yet, this poor understanding of advanced driver assistance systems cannot entirely be blamed on the driver; other factors, such as the availability and quality of instructional sources are also at play (e.g., Abraham et al., 2017). Facilitating access to safety-critical information and standardizing instructional and operational components are two potential routes to increase drivers’ knowledge. However, target areas must be identified. The current study reviewed the degree to which automated systems in passenger vehicles and related information varied among those moderately-priced and luxury models marketed and sold in the United States. Information regarding ten existing longitudinal (e.g., adaptive cruise control) and ten lateral control automated systems (i.e., those that provide sustained lateral control and lane centering) were gathered from OEM websites and operator manuals. Information was coded and synthesized, including the name of the system, the stated functionality, operation, and system constraints as well as the source of the information. Results of this exercise suggest a number of target areas for researchers, OEMs and policy makers to consider in attempts to increase accessibility, knowledge, and ultimately safe usage of these technologies. First, a high degree of variability was observed even among basic characteristics of these technologies such as the system name. This was particularly an issue among luxury automated longitudinal control systems where every system had a fairly different name. While the activation methods were largely consistent across both lateral and longitudinal systems, the deactivation methods varied a great deal both in the allowance of alternative methods and the type of method (if allowed). Moreover, all the systems provided some form of visual feedback to the driver, but this feedback still varied greatly, particularly among lateral systems, in the location of the feedback and the modality that supplemental feedback was presented. System limits for both automated lateral and longitudinal systems were also elucidated. The majority of OEMs reported five types of system limits: curves, stopped vehicles, weather, small obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists), and hills. Similar to the lateral control systems, two OEMs also reported difficulty handling an occupied adjacent lane. These limits were elucidated primarily through the operator manual for each respective model. While some information concerning these limits was available on the website, generally information gathered at this location was restricted. This limited accessibility to information is likely leading to individuals not getting this information, resulting in the poor understanding of these systems observed among owners and even dealers of this technology (Abraham et al., 2017; McDonald et al., 2017). When these individuals do take the time to read the operator manual and do get this information, the variability across systems likely limits their understanding and building of a mental model that supports safe usage over time as they encounter other similar systems.",9/1/2017,3/21/2022 0:00,10/11/2022 16:38,3/21/2022 0:00,1979-1979,,1,61,,Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\IQT6QHK3\Wright et al. - 2017 - An Initial Review of the Instructional and Operati.pdf,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even if the relevance of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and trust on the acceptance of a new system has been already discussed in literature, we considered the role of an external variable such as attitudes towards cyclists in the prediction of an ADAS aimed to improve the safety of cyclists. We administered a questionnaire measuring negative attitudes towards cyclists, trust, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and the behavioural intention to use the system to 480 Italian drivers. Path analysis using Bayesian estimation showed that perceived usefulness, trust in the system, and negative attitudes towards cyclists have a direct effect on the intention to use the ADAS.

The current research provides a qualitative exploration of factors important to people when deciding which car to buy. Open-ended discussion with recent car-buyers revealed the factors which were most important during the participants’ decision making processes, without prompting participants to agree with ideas raised by the experimenter. These issues were explored in two studies, using a series of focus groups (Study 1), and one-on-one interviews (Study 2). In both studies, the two most central factors were issues of practicality and finance, consistent with previous research.

Poisson regression was used to compare rates of police-reported crash involvements per insured vehicle year in 22 U.S. states during 2010–2014 between passenger vehicle models with FCW alone or with AEB and the same models where the optional systems were not purchased, controlling for other factors affecting crash risk.

This paper considers how increasing the level of automation within the sub-tasks of driving may affect the traditional role of the driver. Using the Distributed Cognition approach and Operator Sequence Diagrams as a representational aid, this paper indicates that the level at which automation is set significantly affects the dynamism of the system network.",2/1/2014,10/28/2021 16:33,10/10/2022 21:24,10/28/2021 16:33,505-514,,,62,,Safety Science,Sub-systems on the road to vehicle automation,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\83TCDZJH\S0925753513002397.html,,Include,Automation; Complexity; Distributed cognition; Operator sequence diagram; Pedestrian AEB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A manufacturer would sell their product to a local dealership who would then sell it to the ultimate consumer.' This was true for so long that many states began enacting statutes codifying that market structure in the 1960s after independent dealers raised concerns about the manufacturers using predatory conduct towards them.2 As a result, a system of mandatory vertical disintegration exists across most of the country. Because of this, one could ask his grandfather how he bought his first new car and would likely find himself able to answer the question exactly the same today if he just bought a new car off the lot. And then came the Internet. With the prospect of being able to sell online, costs theoretically should be lower now as consumers easily shop around for the best price for a new car from various dealers across the country, or even directly from the factory. However, these theoretical increases to supply chain efficiencies resulting from Internet retailing have not decreased costs. In fact, e-retailing of new cars is prohibited under nearly every state's laws for the vast majority of manufacturers, that is unless you want to shop online from your neighborhood dealer's website who already contractually controls the local market.4 State motor vehicle laws are proving to be a mechanism for preventing innovation in the new car retailing market for most areas of the country. However, because of subtle, but crucial differences between the state motor vehicle laws, some manufactures are better able to take advantage of the current system. Start-up manufacturers have the choice of vertically integrating their dealer networks in some states, while existing manufacturers cannot in nearly all of them.5 While there may be cost savings for startup manufacturers using this strategy on a state-by-state basis, it also prevents them from entering some states entirely, thus barring revenue prospects. Regardless of the disparity in choices facing manufacturers over how to retail their products depending in part on when they came into existence, a manufacturer, new or old, could make a legal challenge involving the Commerce Clause.6 That is not the only strategy, however. As Tesla Motors found, a piecemeal legislative lobbying strategy is an alternative option for updating outdated state motor vehicle franchising laws.7 Local state administrative agencies also provide some procedural protections if the manufacturer is approved for licensing.8 Manufacturers, both old and new, implementing the strategies discussed in this Note will be better situated to deal with onerous state statutes regulating interactions with their dealership network after adopting a vertically integrated retailing strategy. To start, it is a good idea to understand the origins of these restrictive state statutes.",2014,2/7/2022 22:21,10/10/2022 21:22,2/7/2022 22:21,[i]-596,,2,60,,Wayne L.

Based on police report data, motorcycle operators during this period are examined to reveal key factors that are in place when a motorcyclist is killed in a collision. The major correlates of death identified were objects of impact, risky behaviors, and speed. The largest positive effects on the chances of death were linked to trees, posts-signs-poles, bridge-guardrail-median, and other motor vehicles. In conjunction with speed, these objects were the primary mechanisms by which fatal injuries were sustained by motorcyclists.

The major challenge of PPSs is the development of reliable on-board pedestrian detection systems. Due to the varying appearance of pedestrians (e.g., different clothes, changing size, aspect ratio, and dynamic shape) and the unstructured environment, it is very difficult to cope with the demanded robustness of this kind of system. Two problems arising in this research area are the lack of public benchmarks and the difficulty in reproducing many of the proposed methods, which makes it difficult to compare the approaches. As a result, surveying the literature by enumerating the proposals one–after-another is not the most useful way to provide a comparative point of view. Accordingly, we present a more convenient strategy to survey the different approaches. We divide the problem of detecting pedestrians from images into different processing steps, each with attached responsibilities. Then, the different proposed methods are analyzed and classified with respect to each processing stage, favoring a comparative viewpoint.

The RAD is a behaviour change program designed to reduce aggression in drivers. The RAD focuses on instilling knowledge, as well as modifying the key psychological aspects motivating driver behaviour. The key behaviour modification techniques used to motivate safer onroad behaviour include feedback, goal setting and group discussion. The aim of this project was to evaluate the RAD program and its effectiveness in reducing anger and aggressive driving. Ten two-hour RAD sessions were delivered via zoom between April and June, 2021 with a total of 5 to 14 participants in each. Overall, 94 drivers (Mean age = 38 years; 38% drove in the ACT) completed one RAD session. Process evaluation showed a high degree of support for the RAD, with 87% of participants saying it helped them generate realistic strategies to avoid aggressive driving. The effectiveness of these strategies was measured via online questionnaires regarding anger tendencies and aggressive behaviours one month, and four months after the RAD. Scores for these were compared to baseline measures taken before participation in the RAD. A total of 67 participants completed both follow up measures (28% attrition). Self-reported anger and aggression decreased after the RAD and this effect remained significant at the four month follow up. Thus, providing evidence of the RAD in reducing these dangerous behaviours.

The previously conducted studies of pedestrian and bicycle crashes did not include in-detail analysis. In this study, three years of pedestrian and bicycle crashes (2012-14) were digitized, classified, and analyzed. The classification was based on NHTSA PBCAT and recently proposed LMCM crash typologies. Majority of crashes happened at intersections (68%) and drivers were at fault or violation. The main pedestrian crash type was vehicle left turns (parallel paths) and of bicycles was the case of open door to traffic. The NHTSA crash groups were also identified and top three groups were examined in details and applicable PEDSAFE and BIKESAFE countermeasures were also listed. Due to few cases for some original NHTSA crash groups, new pedestrian and bicycle crash groups were proposed to categorize crashes better in Washington, DC area. Decision trees were developed using CHAID method to investigate contributing factors in fatal and severe injury (disabling) crashes. Traffic control type, crash time, alcohol, speeding, light condition, road type, city quadrant, and fault were contributing factors in more severe pedestrian crashes. Bicycle-only crashes and crashes at construction zones were the identified factors attributing in more severe bicycle crashes.

Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central’s Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols—PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol. This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol.

Despite our anatomical, physiological, and perceptual shortfalls, the fatality rate in the United Stateshit a historic low of 1.1 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in 2011 (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2011). Fatal crash involvement byVMT increases by age starting in the mid-60s (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2011), and many individuals begin to curtail or stop driving. However, the cessation of driving due to advanced age comes at great cost. Agerelated losses in the ability to drive equates, at best, to aforfeiture of personal freedom, reliance on the assistance ofothers to meet basic activities of daily living, and can lead toincreased symptoms of depression (Marottoli et al., 1997).Transitions in driving roles occur throughout one’s lifetime. As medical conditions accrue, they can sporadicallyor permanently limit driving (Owsley, 2004). Women frequently cease driving earlier than men, and often while stillfit to drive (Alsnih & Hensher, 2003; Siren, HakamiesBlomqvist, & Lindeman, 2004). Widowhood can increaseolder women’s need to drive (Braitman & Williams, 2011)at a time when this is particularly challenging. On theother hand, even as adults age, they are becoming increasingly economically able to purchase new vehicles (Coughlin, 2009). As a consequence of both the increased numbers and economic independence of older adults, innovations in personal mobility that mitigate the burdens of agewill grow in value over the coming decades. A move toward new urbanism, including improved public transit systems and walkable streets and sidewalks, is an admirablevision that would help meet the growing needs of manyolder adults. However, it will require, at considerable cost,rebuilding or retrofitting the existing infrastructure at arate that is not likely to meet the needs of today’s agingboomers.Fully automated or driverless cars, by contrast, represent a path that promises to enhance the mobility optionsof older adults within the existing infrastructure. However,many consumers do not clearly understand that while thebasic building blocks of these systems are available todayin advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), fully automated or driverless vehicles are still on the distant horizon. For the foreseeable future, automated vehicle technologies, including ADAS, will continue to rely on a “responsible” driver to oversee the technology, capable of resuming control and having the foresight to make many (yet tobe defined) strategic operational decisions. But because oftheir transformative promise and heavy news coverage, theprospect of automated cars has become a source of greathope for many. Some believe that fully automated cars,capable of navigating the roadways while the “operator”reads a paper or takes a nap, will be available within a fewyears. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Instead, there iswork to be done to increase the awareness and educationnecessary to spur the purchasing of ADAS available today,which will support many older drivers’ mobility and safetyneeds.",2014,3/20/2022 23:55,10/10/2022 0:51,,27-31,,1,24,,,Driver Assistance Systems and the Transition to Automated Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,Dimensions,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\BN8EDQGV\Reimer - 2014 - Driver Assistance Systems and the Transition to Au.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\GK3KP833\prt006.pdf,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends.

Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to over reliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use.",6/1/1997,10/28/2021 16:34,10/9/2022 16:58,10/28/2021 16:34,230-253,,2,39,,Hum Factors,Humans and Automation,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,,,Exclude; Earlier than 2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of different crash report forms on work zone crash data contained in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is examined. An investigation of the data contained in FARS from 1998 to 2000 indicates a statistically significant dependence between the way in which work zones are denoted on a state's crash report form and the percentage of fatalities that are coded as occurring in a work zone.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) could resolve some of these difficulties, by providing personal assistance in a road environment that does not always allow for the possibilities and limitations of the older road user. As a result, ADAS would extend the older adult's safe mobility as a driver. The aim of this paper is to identify the driver tasks for which assistance is most desirable from a road safety perspective. It is assumed that the most promising ADAS in this respect are those that support the relative weaknesses of the older driver. ADAS should not take over the tasks the older driver is actually quite good at. To identify the strengths and weaknesses of the older driver, a literature review is conducted. Various theoretical perspectives are examined, among wich the human factors approach, cognitive psychology, and game theory. This results in a list of the relative weaknesses of the older driver. To further specify the kinds of support most needed, we look at the relation between the weaknesses identified, the problems that older drivers encounter in traffic as a result of these weaknesses, and the resulting number of crashes. This amounts to a shortlist of desired types of support. Next, based on the available literature, relevant ADAS are discussed in terms of their availability, their effects on safety and the willingness of older drivers to use and buy them. One of the conclusions is that only very few of the types of support that are thought to be most beneficial to the safety of older drivers are provided by the ADAS that are currently available.",1/1/2006,9/22/2021 15:21,10/9/2022 16:58,7/27/2021 21:40,20-Jun,,1,30,,IATSS Research,OLDER DRIVERS AND ADAS,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,Number: 1,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\EXC7W55U\Davidse - 2006 - OLDER DRIVERS AND ADAS Which Systems Improve Road.pdf; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\64KPT7SI\S0386111214601515.html,,Exclude; Earlier than 2010,ADAS; Road safety; Driver needs; Models of driver behaviour; Older drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors address this issue for the automobile retailing industry with matched survey and transaction data on 1500 car purchases in California. They show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons: First, the Internet informs consumers about dealers' invoice prices. Second, the referral process of online buying services helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined information and referral price effects are −1.5%, or 22% of dealers' average gross vehicle profit. The authors also find that the benefits of gathering information differ by consumer type. Buyers who have a high disutility of bargaining but who have collected information on the specific car they eventually purchase pay 1.5% less than they otherwise would. In contrast, buyers who like the bargaining process do not benefit from such information.",5/1/2006,2/7/2022 22:21,10/9/2022 16:57,2/7/2022 22:21,168-181,,2,43,,Journal of Marketing Research,How the Internet Lowers Prices,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\IDELYNJA\Zettelmeyer et al. - 2006 - How the Internet Lowers Prices Evidence from Matc.pdf,,Exclude; Earlier than 2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S9QCCIGE,journalArticle,2009,"Hoc, Jean-Michel; Young, Mark S.; Blosseville, Jean-Marc",Cooperation between drivers and automation: implications for safety,Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science,,1463-922X,10.1080/14639220802368856,https://doi.org/10.1080/14639220802368856,"The purpose of this paper is to develop a recently proposed framework of human–machine cooperation (Hoc, J.M., 2001. Towards a cognitive approach to human–machine cooperation in dynamic situations. International Journal of Human–Computer Studies, 54, 509–540) and apply it to the domain of in-car automation. Previous models of automation (e.g. Sheridan, T.B. and Verplanck, W.L., 1978. Human and computer control of undersea teleoperators. Cambridge, MA: MIT Man–Machine Systems Laboratory) delineate the roles of human and machine in a task-based manner and primarily from the viewpoint of machine requirements. However, with increasing arguments that automation should support the human operator rather than replace them (e.g. Young, M.S., Stanton, N.A., and Harris, D., 2007. Driving automation: learning from aviation about design philosophies. International Journal of Vehicle Design, 45(3), 323–338), Hoc's (2001) framework offers a means of modelling the interaction from the perspective of teamwork–that is, from the viewpoint of human requirements. In the present context, the framework describes how both the driver and the automation can be considered as separate agents pursuing their own goals while trying to facilitate a common task, but who may interfere with each other positively (e.g. mutual control) or negatively (mutual conflict). Vehicle automation, as an area of fervent research in ergonomics at present, provides the opportunity to explore the framework and use it to interpret current and emerging research findings. It is suggested here that many of the psychological problems underlying the introduction of in-car automation are a result of suboptimal communications between human and machine, and the framework is used to propose directions for future research in this area.",3/1/2009,10/28/2021 16:33,10/9/2022 16:57,10/28/2021 16:33,135-160,,2,10,,,Cooperation between drivers and automation,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14639220802368856,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\TMIEUUJP\14639220802368856.html,,Exclude; Earlier than 2010,automation; car driving; human–machine cooperation; safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, the role of expectations regarding drivers’ reactions to automated (AVs) and manual vehicles (MVs) was investigated. Interviews were conducted to explore expectations toward AVs and MVs. Then, drivers interacted with AVs and MVs in a multi-agent driving simulator. The vehicles yielded or insisted on the right-of-way, indicated by a lateral offset. Self-report data revealed that drivers expected AVs to drive second (yield) and MVs to drive first (insist) in narrow passages. Driving simulator data showed that driving behavior improved, i.e., faster passing time, higher average speed, and higher lateral position, when AVs yielded and matched drivers’ expectations, compared to MVs that behaved the same way. No improvement was found when MVs (vs. AVs) insisted on the right-of-way. Overall, yielding was evaluated more trustworthy and cooperative than insisting for both vehicle categories.",9/17/2022,9/17/2022 16:40,9/17/2022 16:40,9/17/2022,150–161,,,,,,The Impact of Expectations about Automated and Manual Vehicles on Drivers’ Behavior,AutomotiveUI '22,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\W6EBYYK9\Miller et al. - 2022 - The Impact of Expectations about Automated and Man.pdf,,,Automated vehicles; communication; dHMI; driving behavior; expectations; mixed traffic; narrow passage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: The official EuroNCAP test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)/Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems explicitly defines to what extent a Vehicle-Under-Test (VUT) is allowed to vary in its lateral position. In addition, the United States New Car Assessment Programme (US NCAP) test protocol has broader tolerance ranges. The goal for automotive OEMs is to understand the impact of such allowed variations on a the overall vehicle's performance. Method: A simulation-based approach is outlined that allows systematic, large-scale analysis of such influences to effectively plan time-consuming and resource-intense real-world vehicle tests. Our models allow a profound analysis of an AEB algorithm by modeling and conducting more than 3,000 simulation runs with EuroNCAP's dynamic CCRm and CCRb scenarios including those with adopted USNCAP parameters. Results: Our structured analysis of such test procedures involving dynamic actors is the first of its kind in a relevant industrial setting. Several anomalies were unveiled under US NCAP conditions to support real-world test runs. Hence, we could show that the proposed method supports all possible scenarios in AEB consumer tests and scales as we had to timely process approx. 7.7GB of simulation data. Conclusion: To achieve the expected performance and to study a system's behavior in potential misuse cases from a functional point of view, large scale, model-based simulations complement traditional testing on proving ground.",2015-09,8/30/2022 17:07,8/30/2022 17:07,,2280-2286,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2153-0017,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\Y42AY7KZ\7313460.html; C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\IPLGD7DL\Berger et al. - 2015 - Large-Scale Evaluation of an Active Safety Algorit.pdf,,,Safety; Vehicles; Vehicle dynamics; Data models; Protocols; Systematics; Trajectory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its cognitive effects can be deleterious and lead to uncomfortable or risky situations. While stress detection in this context is well developed, regulation using dedicated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is still emergent.Objectives: This systematic review focuses on stress regulation strategies that can be qualified as “subtle” or “mindless”: the technology employed to perform regulation does not interfere with an ongoing task. The review goal is 2-fold: establishing the state of the art on such technological implementation in the driving context and identifying complementary technologies relying on subtle regulation that could be applied in driving.Methods: A systematic review was conducted using search operators previously identified through a concept analysis. The patents and scientific studies selected provide an overview of actual and potential mindless technology implementations. These are then analyzed from a scientific perspective. A classification of results was performed according to the different stages of emotion regulation proposed by the Gross model.Results: A total of 47 publications were retrieved, including 21 patents and 26 studies. Six of the studies investigated mindless stress regulation in the driving context. Patents implemented strategies mostly linked to attentional deployment, while studies tended to investigate response modulation strategies.Conclusions: This review allowed us to identify several ADAS relying on mindless computing technologies to reduce stress and better understand the underlying mechanisms allowing stress reduction. Further studies are necessary to better grasp the effect of mindless technologies on driving safety. However, we have established the feasibility of their implementation as ADAS and proposed directions for future research in this field.",2020,4/30/2022 16:01,4/30/2022 16:01,4/30/2022 16:01,,,,11,,,Towards Mindless Stress Regulation in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\RBIEGAG7\Béquet et al. - 2020 - Towards Mindless Stress Regulation in Advanced Dri.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If divergence exists between expectations and actual design specifications, it may make it harder to develop trust or clear expectations of systems, thus mitigating potential benefits. Alternately, over-trust and misuse due to misunderstanding increase the potential for adverse events. An online survey investigated whether and how names of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automation features relate to expected automation levels. Systems with ""Cruise"" in their names were associated with lower levels of automation. ""Assist"" systems appeared to create confusion between whether the driver is assisting the system or vice versa. Survey findings indicate the importance of vehicle technology naming and its impact in influencing drivers' expectations of responsibility between the driver and system in who performs individual driving functions.",9/24/2017,3/20/2022 23:47,4/30/2022 15:53,3/20/2022,226–234,,,,,,What's in a Name,AutomotiveUI '17,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Quan\Zotero\storage\WIWBMXJX\Abraham et al. - 2017 - What's in a Name Vehicle Technology Branding &amp.pdf,,,Automation; Advanced Driver Assistance Systems; Branding; Confusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RJWDCXGU,bookSection,2020,"Noble, Alexandria M.; Klauer, Sheila Garness; Machiani, Sahar Ghanipoor; Manser, Michael P.","Importance of Training for Automated, Connected, and Intelligent Vehicle Systems","Handbook of Human Factors for Automated, Connected, and Intelligent Vehicles",978-1-315-26968-9,,,,"The mere idea of automated, connected, and intelligent vehicles (ACIVs) conjures up visions in which our vehicles cater to our every transportation need. The development and deployment of ACIV systems, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that help control vehicle acceleration, vehicle deceleration, and lane position, has the potential to improve safety by relieving drivers of tasks that they are prone to performing with errors. However, providing this additional support to drivers also fundamentally changes the human driving task from one of manual control to one of supervisory control. Additionally, as higher levels of ACIV systems become commercially available, the driving task changes further from requiring near constant human supervision to infrequent vehicle system assistance. Despite this dramatic change to the driving task, there has been relatively little work examining the efficacy of training practices and learner-centered human–machine interface (HMI) design to positively impact the safety of ACIV systems, which is likely a critical factor in promoting a safe human/vehicle partnership. This chapter summarizes the general concept of HMI design for ACIVs and provides information on specific training-related factors. The first section, Training Overview, will briefly discuss the importance of training, including ways in which a human–vehicle partnership can be enhanced through training, while the second section addresses the critical question of what content should be included in the training protocols for ACIV systems. The third section, titled Andragogical Considerations for ACIV Systems Training, will identify both driver and non-driver related key factors that should be considered in the development of training protocols. The fourth section provides a review of both current and future protocols that could be employed to train people on the use of ACIV systems. The chapter concludes with a series of recommendations for ACIV systems training practices. This chapter will serve as a foundation for driver training stakeholders, technology developers, consumers, and legislatures to address the growing need to include relevant and effective training for ACIV systems as these technologies are developed and deployed.",2020,3/20/2022 23:58,3/20/2022 23:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRC Press,,,,,,,,,Num Pages: 26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two separate nationwide surveys were administered among consumers and car sellers across The Netherlands to gain insight on how they are currently informed about ADAS. The results of our study show several issues about the way that both consumers and car sellers are informed about ADAS. First, almost a quarter of the drivers did not receive any information about the ADAS in the car that they bought. Of the drivers that did receive information, only 9% was able to try out the automated systems before taking the car home. Almost 40% of the car sellers did not receive (sufficient) information about ADAS. However, brand dealers more often received sufficient information about ADAS compared to independent dealers.

Level 3 automated driving systems are expected to increase safety, comfort and traffic efficiency. For the human driver, these functions and according human-machine interfaces are a novel technology. In the human factors domain, research and development faces two challenges which are (1) the conceptualization of intuitive and easy to use interfaces and (2) the development of a methodological framework to evaluate these interfaces. In technology evaluation, a methodological phenomenon has frequently been reported which is called the preference-performance dissociation. It describes the outcome of studies where users’ preference (i.e., self-report) does not match their performance (i.e., interaction behavior). This phenomenon poses a threat to the evaluation of automated vehicle HMIs. Therefore, this chapter first reports a review and discussion of studies that investigated the operationalization of both measures. Moreover, the understanding (i.e., mental model) of automated vehicle HMIs is an influential precursor of performance and included in the present work. Using the insights of the operationalization part, the second part of this work aimed at finding out about factors that exert influence on preference and/or performance. Investigated factors were the number of use case repetitions, feedback on operator performance, user education and a post-hoc statistical analysis. To reach the operationalization and variation aims, three driving simulator studies with a total of N = 225 participants were conducted. The main outcomes were that (1) a sophisticated recommendation regarding preference questionnaire application is presented. Furthermore, (2) insights into the development of behavioral measures over time and their relation to a satisfaction measure could be given. Concerning mental models, (3) the present work showed that it takes repeated interaction to evolve accurately and gaze measures could also be used for capturing these processes. In addition, (4) feedback on operator performance was found to influence preference but not performance while (5) user education increased understanding and subsequent performance but did not affect preference. Eventually it showed that (6) users of different performance levels report similar preference. The theoretical contribution of this work lies in insights into the formation of the two sources of data and its potential to both explain and predict the preference-performance dissociation. The practical contribution lies in the recommendation for research methodology regarding how to operationalize measures and how to design user studies concerning the number of use cases and user education approaches. Finally, the results gained herein do not only apply to automated vehicle HMIs but might also be generalized to related domains such as aviation, robotics or health care.",2022,1/10/2022 16:31,1/10/2022 16:31,1/10/2022 16:31,179-205,,,,,,,Studies in Computational Intelligence,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-77726-5_8,,,,,Adaptive Cruise Control; Human-Computer Interaction; Human-Machine Interface; Operational Design Domain; System Usability Scale,"Riener, Andreas; Jeon, Myounghoon; Alvarez, Ignacio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, until fully automated vehicles are available in the market, drivers are still expected to allocate some level of attention to the driving environment and take over the driving task if necessary. Attentive user interfaces (AUIs) are interfaces that adapt based on the operator’s state and task/environmental demands to manage and direct the operator’s attention. In this chapter, we examine how AUIs can be used to modulate drivers’ attention in automated vehicles. We begin by discussing the frameworks that have been used to define AUIs, followed by the relationship between workload, arousal, and attention. We then review the research on AUIs in the driving context and discuss opportunities for further research.",2022,1/10/2022 16:31,1/10/2022 16:31,1/10/2022 16:31,305-334,,,,,,Attentive User Interfaces,Studies in Computational Intelligence,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-77726-5_12,,,,,Automated driving; Adaptive interfaces; Driver attention; Driver distraction,"Riener, Andreas; Jeon, Myounghoon; Alvarez, Ignacio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
